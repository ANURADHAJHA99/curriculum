# AJAX

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Motivation
To build on front end knowledge with the addition of async functionality. 


### Objective
**Students will be able to** identify AJAX, understand how JSON is used for API calls, and make asynchronous calls to an API.

### Specific Things To Teach
- what is async and how Ajax works to extend functionality 
- key value pairs- what they are and how to use them
- APIs (e.g., Google Maps)
- promises

### Materials

- [MDN- Ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX)
- [AJAX Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l13qGLTgNws)

### Mini Lesson

After watching the video, reinforce the main points. Introduce students to the tutorial, pairing them to collaboratively work on the tutorial. 



### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

Although X in Ajax stands for XML, JSON is used more than XML nowadays because of its many advantages such as being lighter and a part of JavaScript. Both JSON and XML are used for packaging information in Ajax model.



### Guided Practice

We will examine and play with this code: [Demo Code Environment](https://www.freehttps://www.w3schools.com/xml/tryit.asp?filename=tryajax_first)


### Independent Practice

Students will complete the JSON/API tutorial via FCC.
