# Roles in Tech

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Prerequisites
- Learning to Learn lesson
- Professionalism lesson

### Motivation
While Techtonica is training you to become a software engineer, there are lots of other technical and non-technical roles available to people working in the tech industry!

### Objective
**Students will be able to** 
- Talk about the kind of work various non-engineer employees do in the tech industry

### Specific Things To Teach
- Engineering specialties
- Security & testing job descriptions
- Data & analytics job descriptions
- Developer support job descriptions
- Management descriptions

### Materials
- [Roles in Tech lesson slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1thHjKNbpTh3lp6BtFjSS5HqgCrMQl9EO9LdLgLHBdMA/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Roles in Tech lab exercise](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/roles-in-tech/lab-exercise.md)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- "Since I'm attending a software engineering apprenticeship program, the only job in tech I'll be able to get after this will be as a junior software engineer." (False!)
- "If I take a non-software-engineering job after Techtonica I'll be a failure / I'll have let people down." (False!)
- "Techtonica guarantees me a job as a software engineer after I complete the program." (Very, very False.)
- "The only employees at a tech company who really matter are the engineers." (Extra False.)

### Independent Practice
- [Roles in Tech project](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/roles-in-tech/lab-exercise.md)

### Challenge
On their own, participants can look up job ads for roles they are interested in and make a list of the common skills and job responsibilities needed in order to qualify.

### Check for Understanding
In a round table discussion format, students share and compare notes from the conversations they had during the project portion of this topic.
