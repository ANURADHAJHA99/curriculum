### Is your project feasible?
[ ] Can I accomplish my main features in just 2 weeks? 
[ ] Can I get the information I need?
[ ] Does this project showcase the skills I want to showcase? 
[ ] Will I learn the things I want to learn? 


### Extensions
- What other features or improvements can I add to my app?
- Extensions are designed for Apprentices who are moving through the material faster than their classmates. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this lab exercise. Students should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next lab exercise.
