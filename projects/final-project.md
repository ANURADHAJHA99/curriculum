## Final Project Template

### Goal
Build a well-scoped application that a few defined features to demonstrate how much you've learned! The end-product should be a project that you can describe the features of your app, demo it, and include a well documented GitHub repo. 

### Environment

- Chrome Developer Tools
- Atom
- TDD Jasmine 
- Scrum
- Terminal
- Git
- GitHub 

### Languages
- JavaScript with examples in your code where you include RegEx, Datetime, Objects, 
Arrays, Functions, Conditionals, for and while loops, and design patterns.
- HTML 
- CSS & Sass
- SQL

### Libraries
- jQuery or React
- Bootstrap 
- AJAX 

### Frameworks
- Express

### Environment
- Node 

### Databases 
- MongoDB or SQL
Project Requirements - 

### Primary Goals
1. Use this project template as an objective guideline and as a starting point for your project READ.me
2. Request code reviews and receive and incorporate constructive feedback for your project
3. Use UX/UI design best practices
4. Implement an OAuth Library such as 
5. Use an API with 3 calls
6. Use one of the data structures and algorithms covered during presentations
7. Include basic web accessibility
8. Make sure your app is web and mobile friendly so use media queries, flex box, and start with mobile responsive in mind.


### Overview
In this project, you will create a project that satisfies all of the primary goals outlined in steps 1 - 8.

### Basic Requirements
1. Apprentices will obtain a code review every other day.

### Part 1 - Brainstorm and Planning

#### Brainstorm

Brainstorm a couple project ideas! Some sources of inspiration: 
- Reflect on your day-to-day: where do you see an opportunity for an optimization or an improvement? What do you spend a lot of thought capital on? It could be figuring out public transit connections, determining whether to bike or walk to work, a small tool that can help with a task, or even a current application you use that is missing a feature
- Consider whether a feature into a standalone project. Look at some of your favorite apps, sites, or products. Can you re-purpose and improve upon one of its features?
- Is there a data set you would love to dive into? (Think tweets, Yelp reviews, other apps - lots of these have APIs!)
- Read through some sample projects / code: 
    - [Hack Reactor Student Projects](https://www.hackreactor.com/student-projects/)
    - [Hackbright Student Final Projects](http://hackbrightacademy.com/student-projects/)

Choose a project that gives you something to talk about during your job search! Don't worry about if it's been done before or if it's practical - will you be excited to explore and learn through your project. 

**Deliverable for meeting with mentor:** 
2-3 project ideas. With each project idea, include: 
- 3-7 possible features
- Information or datasets needed

**Post-mentor meeting outcome:** 
1-2 project ideas (with top preference in mind) including: 
- Main feature/s that are necessary for the MVP 
- Answers to the questions: 
    [ ] Can I accomplish my main features in just 2 weeks? 
    [ ] Can I get the information I need?
    [ ] Does this project showcase the skills I want to showcase? 
    [ ] Will I learn the things I want to learn? 

#### Design
##### Data - What data do you need?

Research Your Options 
- Is the information freely available? APIs, Open Data, User Data and more... 
- Don't be afraid to sign up for access to the information. 
- Ask for the data. (Don't be afraid to email and ask for it.) 

Working with Data 
Deal with the data you have access to easily, rather than wasting time or money on data which is hard to obtain. 
- Consider dummy datasetsâ€”don't make your project about "perfect data" 
- Don't worry about getting 100% of the data extracted. 

##### User Flows 
 
##### Wireframes 




**Week 16**  

[Add screenshots or images whenever possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) to clarify what you mean, and so Apprentices can verify they've done the task correctly.

> **PAUSE.** Obtain a code review from the Techtonica #tech-help Slack channel or the Techtonica program facilitator.

### Extensions
- What other features or improvements can I add to my app?
- Extensions are designed for Apprentices who are moving through the material faster than their classmates. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this lab exercise. Students should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next lab exercise.
