# Final Project

## Goal
Build a well-scoped application with a few defined features to demonstrate how much you've learned! In the end, you should be able to describe the features of your app, demo it, and include a well-documented GitHub repo. 



## Brainstorm

Brainstorm some project ideas! Some sources of inspiration:

- Reflect on your day-to-day: where do you see an opportunity for an optimization or an improvement? What do you spend a lot of thought capital on? It could be figuring out public transit connections, determining whether to bike or walk to work, a small tool that can help with a task, or even a current application you use 
- Consider whether to make a feature into a standalone project. Look at some of your favorite apps, sites, or products. Can you re-purpose and improve upon one of its features?
- Is there a dataset you would love to dive into? (Think tweets, Yelp reviews, other apps - lots of these have APIs!)
- Read through some sample projects / code: 
    - [Hack Reactor Student Projects](https://www.hackreactor.com/student-projects/)
    - [Hackbright Student Final Projects](http://hackbrightacademy.com/student-projects/)

Choose a project that gives you something to talk about during your job search! Don't worry about if it's been done before or if it's practical - will you be excited to explore and learn through your project?




### **Deliverable(s) to share with mentor:** 

2-3 project ideas. With each project idea, include:
 
- 3-7 possible features
- Information or datasets needed

### **Post-mentor meeting outcome:** 

1-2 project ideas (with top preference in mind) including: 

- Main features necessary for the MVP 
- Answers to the questions: 
    - [ ] Can I accomplish my main features in just 2 weeks? 
    - [ ] Can I get the information I need?
    - [ ] Does this project showcase the skills I want to showcase? 
    - [ ] Will I learn the things I want to learn? 



## Designing Your MVP

[Designing Your MVP Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJCFwZ6e9LO-DVkv2QQN1WgNfZkKW_KuWdmEWpRBAQA/edit?usp=sharing)

### **Deliverable to share with mentor:** 

- Your MVP definition: core functionality and feature list
- User flow 
- Wireframes for your apps pages
- Data model
 
### **Post-mentor meeting outcome:**

- Sign off on drafts for user flow, wireframes, and data models
- Select which feature to work on first 



## Start coding! 

"A feature" is a single action that you want the user to be able to do. 
E.g. "be able to login" or "be able to enter measurement data and have it saved"

**Feature Lifecycle**
Given your selected feature, break down the feature into parts. 
The parts should cover the whole life cycle of doing something. 
For example, a login requires: 

- Login html and logout html. 
- Routes to handle the login/logout. 
- Session to store the user ID, etc. for logged-in user. 
- Database querying to confirm user is registered. 
- Registration to create new user. (Optional, perhaps after MVP.) 

Scoping Features
When designing a feature, make sure to NOT OVERDESIGN. Keep asking yourself: 
What skill do I want this feature to show off? Is this feature in the "golden path" of my core functionality? 

Once you have the feature broken down, start coding it! Check in often with your mentor or #tech-help. **Once the simplest version of a feature is done, move to the next feature until you have completed all the necessary features for your MVP.**



## What happens after the main features? 

### After the MVP is complete:
Cut a "complete_mvp" branch! Leave it alone as a place to easily build on top of your MVP by making new branches from it as needed. 

Build your extra features slotted for Stage 2, 3, etc. 

Consider: 

- Tests (unit tests, integration tests. Companies love seeing this!) 
- Bootstrap for additional UX experience 
- Improving the user interface and overall aesthetic 
- Interactive components of bootstrap (tooltips, etc) 
- Refactoring your code 
- Breaking large code blocks into modular units. 
- Removing any redundant code (duplication of code is a clue that this code block should be encapsulated into a reusable function).
- Using code as documentation
- Self explanatory variable and function names.
- Function calls that make it evident what is happening 



### After the Code Freeze
 
Add final polish to your site, including:

- Documentation (doc strings in function, or at start of file) 
- GitHub readme. 
- Practice demoing your app and presenting it.
- Work with CSS, colors, fonts, images etc. (Do not add major Bootstrap components during the code freeze!) It will be tempting to make changes or add one more thing. It's too easy to convince yourself that adding that one last tiny feature is what will make your project truly great. No. You are what makes your project great! Don't risk breaking something the day before or on demo day. Last-minute changes will break something 99% of the time no matter how benign they seem. Don't risk it. You can add that feature later. Instead, spend that time practicing your pitch.
