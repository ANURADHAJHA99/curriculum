## Portfolio Project with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

### Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- bash

### Frameworks
- Bootstrap

### Other Skills
- VS code
- keyboard shortcuts

### Primary Goals
To demonstrate understanding of the topics covered in the first two weeks of this course.

### Overview
In this project, you will build a simple portfolio page to practice what you've learned about VSCode, HTML, CSS, Git, and Bootstrap. This should take about 3 hours.

### Context
- A great portfolio page will be valuable way to showcase your skills as you look for engineering work.
- After you've learned more coding skills and tools, you will be making this site even better.

### Basic Requirements
1. Participants will obtain a code review by asking for a code review using the Techtonica #tech-help Slack Channel.
2. Participants will submit and present project by assigned date.

## Setup Instructions
- Open VS Code and follow along.
- Work on the same part of your site as the video if you can, but it doesnâ€™t have to look the same.
- When the tutorial moves on, move on with it, and finish what you were doing later.
- Include your new coding skills in your resume!


When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znMOomkIkAkFKIz2e6t5tLpyzObKqOwfd90fsixSiec/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance.

Navigate to the `techtonica-labs` folder located in your Desktop.
Create a new folder called `getting-started-with-node` within the `techtonica-labs` folder.
Navigate to `getting-started-with-node`.
Initialize `getting-started-with-node` as a git repository.

If you have questions, do not disturb other pairs until you have spent 15-20 minutes troubleshooting within your own pair. Post a message on the #help channel in Slack if you and your pair partner are still stuck after 15-20 minutes. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O45nkq2bZX4ZDenmmA1lJ3iTvI80RXiPuOX2w__6Ykw/edit?usp=sharing) lesson.

### Starter Code
There is no starter code for this project. You can do it!  

### Project

-----

#### Part 1 - Build your amazing portfolio page in with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

**Create your project**
- [ ] Use bash to create a local portfolio-website directory.  In the directory, make an index.html and an index.css.
- [ ] Using your command line, type ```git init``` and set up your repo.
- [ ] Create a remote repo for the project in your github account.
- [ ] Using your command line, add and commit your portfolio-website directory, and then do a git push.
- [ ] Open your portfolio-website directory in VS Code using your command line.

**HTML**  
- [ ] Use VS Code shortcuts to create boilerplate code for your html file.
- [ ] In the body, create <h1>s, <h2>s, <p>s etc to make a basic header for your online resume, plus a couple of coding experience entries.
- [ ] Add a title tag to your file.
- [Check out this video for an html example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gyHLJeBPCw&index=2&list=PLsIkqR8inizt8SpD6utVTPhy8gFQzQNug)

**CSS**
- [ ] Link your index.css file inside index.html.
- [ ] Style your text and your photo: Add a few classes to your html tags, and use those classes to write some CSS rules in your index.css. [This video continues the html project in the last link, and has some css examples.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z02GfaSfOY&index=4&list=PLsIkqR8inizt8SpD6utVTPhy8gFQzQNug)
- [ ] Use an <img> tag to add a profile photo of yourself. [Video: Add a profile photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9UiWpXizX4&list=PLsIkqR8inizt8SpD6utVTPhy8gFQzQNug&index=8)

**Bootstrap**  
- [ ] Link bootstrap.css to your index.html file.
- [ ] Create a *navigation bar* that includes your name as the *page title*, and at least two *links* including your github profile and linkedin profile.
- [ ] Use at least two bootstrap tags or classes to style your nav bar.

-----

#### Part 2 - Save it using your command line, Git, and deploy on Github

**git status, git diff, git add, git commit -m "my message", git push**  
- [ ] To save your first draft, type ```git status``` in your command line, and git diff each changed file to be sure the changes are what you want.
- [ ] Add the changed files one at a time, commit with a short message about what you changed, and git push.

**Go live with GitHub**
- [ ] Go into the settings of your portfolio-website repo in Github.  Near the bottom, there is a section to make your site live.  
  - If you click the link it gives you, but your site doesn't show up, try adding a github template to it and try again.  The template will not change your site.
  - If you are still getting errors instead of seeing your portfolio site, press ```option+command+i``` and check out your console for any errors.

> **PAUSE.** After about 2 hours, obtain a code review from Techtonica #tech-help Slack channel. Be sure to include a link to your new github repo, and mention whether you have fulfilled the requirements, or if you are stuck and need advice. Remember to ask good questions!

### Questions to Consider
- Have you chosen fonts, styles, colors, and positioning that are professional enough that you could share this with a potential employer?
- Do you have any past leadership experience or a unique background that would be an asset to an employer aside from your coding skills? (This is where career-changers often have an advantage.)
- Are you using good ergonomics?

### Extensions
- Get up and spend 10 minutes to see how other apprentices approached the assignment.
- Spend what remains of your 3 hours to make improvements to your portfolio site, and be sure to push your changes up to github.
- If you have extra time, add a menu dropdown to your navigation bar using bootstrap. Remember to link bootstrap.js in your html file.
