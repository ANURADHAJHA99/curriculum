## Portfolio Project  

### Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- bash

### Frameworks
- Bootstrap

### Primary Goals
To demonstrate understanding of the topics covered in the first two week of this course.

### Overview
In this project, you will build a simple portfolio page to practice what you've learned about VSCode, HTML, CSS, Git, and Bootstrap.

### Context
- A great portfolio page will be valuable way to showcase your skills as you look for engineering work.
- After you've learned more coding skills and tools, you will be making this site even better.

### Basic Requirements
1. Participants will obtain a code review by asking for a code review using the Techtoncia #tech-help Slack Channel.
2. Participants will submit and present project by assigned date.
- Use shortcuts you’ve learned!

## Setup Instructions
- Open VS Code and follow along.
- Work on the same part of your site as the video if you can, but it doesn’t have to look the same. 
- When the tutorial moves on, move on with it, and finish what you were doing later.
- Include your new coding skills in your resume! 


When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znMOomkIkAkFKIz2e6t5tLpyzObKqOwfd90fsixSiec/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance.

Navigate to the `techtonica-labs` folder located in your Desktop. 
Create a new folder called `getting-started-with-node` within the `techtonica-labs` folder. 
Navigate to `getting-started-with-node`. 
Initialize `getting-started-with-node` as a git repository. 

If you have questions, do not disturb other pairs until you have spent 15-20 minutes troubleshooting within your own pair. Post a message on the #help channel in Slack if you and your pair partner are still stuck after 15-20 minutes. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O45nkq2bZX4ZDenmmA1lJ3iTvI80RXiPuOX2w__6Ykw/edit?usp=sharing) lesson.

#### Part 1 - Build your amazing portfolio page in with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

**HTML**  
1. Use bash to create a local portfolio-website directory.  In the directory, make an index.html and an index.css.
2. Open your portfolio-website directory in VS Code using your command line.
3. Use VS Code shortcuts to create boilerplate code for your html file.
4. In the body, create <h1>s, <h2>s, <p>s etc to make a basic header for your online resume, plus a couple of coding experience entries.
5. [Check out this video for an html example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gyHLJeBPCw&index=2&list=PLsIkqR8inizt8SpD6utVTPhy8gFQzQNug)

**CSS**
1. Add some classes to your html tags, and use the classes to write some CSS rules in you index.css.
2. [This video continues the html project in the last link, and has some css examples.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z02GfaSfOY&index=4&list=PLsIkqR8inizt8SpD6utVTPhy8gFQzQNug)
3. Use an <img> tag to add a profile photo of yourself. [Video: Add a profile photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9UiWpXizX4&list=PLsIkqR8inizt8SpD6utVTPhy8gFQzQNug&index=8)

**Bootstrap**  
Etiam eleifend est ac auctor pretium. Pellentesque eu quam urna. Morbi mattis purus at iaculis ornare. Sed id felis felis. Etiam euismod ante vel augue dictum, sed finibus arcu iaculis. Suspendisse maximus congue pharetra. Phasellus at sem vel sapien tincidunt porttitor vitae sit amet quam. Praesent sodales nisl elit, id vehicula nulla faucibus vel.

[Add screenshots or images whenever possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) to clarify what you mean, and so participants can verify they've done the task correctly.

#### Part 2 - Save it using your command line, Git, and Github

**git status and git diff**  
Etiam eleifend est ac auctor pretium. Pellentesque eu quam urna. Morbi mattis purus at iaculis ornare. Sed id felis felis. Etiam euismod ante vel augue dictum, sed finibus arcu iaculis. Suspendisse maximus congue pharetra. Phasellus at sem vel sapien tincidunt porttitor vitae sit amet quam. Praesent sodales nisl elit, id vehicula nulla faucibus vel.

### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the project to what was covered in the given weeks Topic Outlines.
- Ask questions that connect this project to prior Topic Outlines or Independent Practice.
- Also ask questions that require the participants to put together multiple pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer or opinion.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can you as an participants work on once you have fulfilled the basic requirements for this project? 
- What do these deliverables add to their understanding of the topic?
- Extensions are designed for participants who are moving through the material faster than other participants. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this project. Participants should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next Topic Outline.
