**GitHub Collaboration / Writing Readable Code / Documentation**  
- [ ] Fork your partner's project and use git to download it to your computer.
- [ ] Create a new branch and make changes on that as you review your partner's project code.
- [ ] Refactor code to make it more readable using whitespace at least once.  (If this is on your own project, practice making a PR for your changes rather than saving it straight to master.)
- [ ] Refactor code to make it more readable using a more clear/descriptive tag, class, id, or possibly a file name.  (If this is on your own project, practice making a PR for your changes rather than saving it straight to master.)

- [ ] Resolve any merge conflicts before merging to master.

**Deploying a client-side app with netlify**
