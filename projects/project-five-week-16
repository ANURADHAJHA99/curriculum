### Questions to Consider

### Extensions
- Questions to ask yourself: What deliverables can you work on once you have fulfilled the basic requirements for deliverables?
- Extensions are designed for Apprentices who are moving through the material faster than their classmates. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this lab exercise. Students should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next lab exercise.
