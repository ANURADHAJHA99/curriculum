### Primary Goals
1.Use this project template as an objective guideline and as a starting point for your project READ.me
2. Request code reviews and receive and incorporate constructive feedback for your project
3. Use UX/UI Design Best Practices
4. Implement an OAuth Library such as 
5. Use An API with 3 calls
6. Use One of the data structures and algorithms covered during presentations
7. Basic web accessibility
8. Make sure your app is web and mobile friendly so use media queries, flex box, and start with mobile responsive in mind.


### Overview
In this Project, you will create a project that satisfies all of the primary goals outlined in steps 1 - 6.

### Context
- This is what you already know, and we are building on top of it
- This is why you are doing this particular lab exercise 
- This is the value to your future self if you do this lab exercise

### Basic Requirements
1. Apprentices will obtain a code review after (thing you want them to complete)

## Setup Instructions (DO NOT DELETE - GOES IN EVERY LAB EXERCISE)
Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on [Shell Commands](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LuOLcpSAtNQlbULx9nWgXJNhgWQlfQ4nzLWQ0DuuPQk/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance on using the Terminal.

When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znMOomkIkAkFKIz2e6t5tLpyzObKqOwfd90fsixSiec/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance.

 Lab Exercise

-----

#### Part 1 - Thing they will do (should match Basic Requirement 1 from above)

**First step**  

[Add screenshots or images whenever possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) to clarify what you mean, and so Apprentices can verify they've done the task correctly.

**Second step**  

[Add screenshots or images whenever possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) to clarify what you mean, and so Apprentices can verify they've done the task correctly.

**Third step**  
[Add screenshots or images whenever possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) to clarify what you mean, and so Apprentices can verify they've done the task correctly.

> **PAUSE.** Obtain a code review from the Techtonica #tech-help Slack channel or the Techtonica program facilitator.

### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the lab exercise to what was covered in the associated lecture.
- Also ask questions that connect this lab exercise to prior lessons.
- Also ask questions that require the Apprentice to put together multiple pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer or opinion.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can Apprentices work on once they have fulfilled the basic requirements for this lab exercise? 
- What do these deliverables add to their understanding of the topic?
- Extensions are designed for Apprentices who are moving through the material faster than their classmates. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this lab exercise. Students should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next lab exercise.
