### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the lab exercise to what was covered in the associated lecture.
- Also ask questions that connect this lab exercise to prior lessons.
- Also ask questions that require the Apprentice to put together multiple pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer or opinion.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can Apprentices work on once they have fulfilled the basic requirements for this lab exercise? 
- What do these deliverables add to their understanding of the topic?
- Extensions are designed for Apprentices who are moving through the material faster than their classmates. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this lab exercise. Students should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next lab exercise.
