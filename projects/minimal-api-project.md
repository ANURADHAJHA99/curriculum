### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the project to what was covered in the given weeks Topic Outlines.
- Ask questions that connect this project to prior Topic Outlines or Independent Practice.
- Also ask questions that require the participants to put together multiple pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer or opinion.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can you as an participants work on once you have fulfilled the basic requirements for this project? 
- What do these deliverables add to their understanding of the topic?
- Extensions are designed for participants who are moving through the material faster than other participants. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this project. Participants should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next Topic Outline.
