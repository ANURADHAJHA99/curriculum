## Week 7 Assessment - Build a Minimal API Project

### Languages
- JS
- Git
- bash
- SQL

### Frameworks
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
- **add testing frameworks
- ExpressJS

### Libraries/Tools
- NodeJS
- [ElephantSQL](https://api.elephantsql.com/)
- [express-generator](https://github.com/expressjs/generator)

### Primary Goals
This assessment will check for proficiency in: NodeJS, ExpressJS, Data Models, .env secrets, SQL, Relational Databases, Database Migrations, and Express Unit tests.

### Overview
In this project, you will build a minimal Express API to demonstrate your understanding of backend technologies. This should take about 6 hours, and is due by 5pm on Friday.

### Context
- This is what you already know, and we are building on top of it

### Basic Requirements
1. Participants will obtain a code review by asking for a code review using the Techtoncia #tech-help Slack Channel.
2. Participants will submit and present project by assigned date.

## Project Instructions

### Starter Code
1. Start with an express app using the [express app generator](https://github.com/expressjs/generator).
  On your command line, navigate to your projects folder and enter:
  ```
  $ npm install -g express-generator
  $ express --no-view /minimal-express-api && cd /minimal-express-api
  $ npm install; open http://localhost:3000; npm start
  ```
  You should be able to see "Welcome to Express" at localhost:3000 in your browser. You already have a node/express app!

2. Initialize your new project folder for git, and get your GitHub upstream repo ready so you can save and push as you make progress on your project.  You will be submitting your GitHub repo link once you finish.

3. Think of an example of a person and their work.  This could be a user and their blog posts, an artist and their paintings, and author and their books, a coder and their projects, a baker and their pastries, etc.  Pick or come up with a set; this will help you think of names for your data.

### Project

#### Part 1 - Create a complete minimal API with your Express App.

**NodeJS & ExpressJS**
- Your API endpoint should allow users to retrieve something from your database.
- There should also be an endpoint to query just one field or one value from your table.

**Data Models**  
- Draw a clear data model digitally or by hand for Part 1 of your project, and add the picture to a project README.md

**SQL**  
- Create a new DB instance on elephantsql.com.
- Follow your data model to create a table in the "Browser" section of elephantsql.com.

**.env**  
- Save all details from your database instance into your local project securely, making them into variables usable in your js files.

**Unit Tests**  
- Create at least one passing unit test for each API endpoint.

```PAUSE:  Take a lunch break, and then move onto part 2.```

-----

#### Part 2 - 

**Data Models**  
- Draw a clear data model digitally or by hand for Part 2 of your project, and add the picture to a project README.md

**Relational Databases**  
- something

**Database Migrations**  
- Add a 'person' table (user, artist, baker, or whatever you chose)
- 

**Unit Tests**  
- Create at least one passing unit test for each GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE route.
-----

#### Part 3 - Turn in your project
- Your project should run.  Be sure to add clear directions for starting your app in your readme.md
- Push your final project up to your GitHub repo.  Be sure that your readme appears in the main repo page, your image(s) load successfully, and that your markdown notation is correct.
- Email your repo URL to your Program Manager.

### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the project to what was covered in the given weeks Topic Outlines.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can you as an participants work on once you have fulfilled the basic requirements for this project?
