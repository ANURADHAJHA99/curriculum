# Restaurant Recommender System with Javascript - Part 2


### Primary Goals
To build UI and client-side tests for an Object Oriented application.

### Overview
You'll build a Restaurant Recommender app that will
help you practice building a complete client-side Object Oriented application. This is due to the Program Facilitor at the end of the day on Thursday.

### Context
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a popular style of programming that is oftentimes
adopted for Backend Code Organization.
* OOP enables
    * Readability (esp in a large code base)
    * Function abstraction
    * Easier testing
* Displaying Object Oriented Programming Skills in an interview is extremely impressive, and shows your ability to design and organize systems.


### User Requirements

1. Now that your Restaurant Recommender class in complete, you should be able to *create a User Interface with jQuery* for *each* of the following methods:

* Users:
    * Add a new User to the System
    * Update a User's Rating for a Restaurant
    * Delete a User from the System
    * Delete a User's rating for a Restaurant
* Restaurant:
    * Add a new Restaurant to the System
    * Update a Restaurant's categories
    * Maintain a Restaurant's "average" score every time a new user score is added.
    * Delete a Restaurant from the System
* Category:
    * Add a new Category to the System
    * Update Restaurants in a Category
    * Delete a Category from the System
* Filter:
    * All Restaurants in a certain category (order does not matter)
    * All Restaurants with an Average Score greater than "X" in decreasing order
    * Top "X" number of restaurants in decreasing order in a certain category
    * Note: You can use three separate filter functions or _one_ if you'd like an extra challenge :)

2. You will need to add *Jasmine Tests* for *each* of the above methods.

3. You are required to *deploy* your completed project using Netlify or Github Pages. Send the links to your *Github repo* and *live site url* to the program facilitator by 5pm on Thursday.

4. You are required to have a top-notch README.md with screenshots of your project in your Github project repo.

#### Tips:
- Although your wireframe will not be assessed, we highly recommend looking at websites that have successfully created UI for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and filtering data, and wireframe your design before starting to code with jQuery, HTML, or CSS.  It will be much easier overall!

#### Good luck!
