# Searching Arrays

### Projected Time
?

### Prerequisites
- Arrays

### Motivation
Searching for an item in an array is a common need. Software developers should know the possible algorithms for searching and which is best for different use cases.

### Objective
**Students will be able to**:
- Understand how linear and binary search work
- Understand the runtime of linear and binary search
- Know when to use linear and binary search

### Specific Things To Teach

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- Binary search can only be used on sorted arrays
- Binary search is not always faster than linear search -- for small arrays, linear search can be faster


### Independent Practice

- Write linear search to find a given item in an array

- Say you have an array and want to find the number closest to a given number n. Write a linear search to find the closest number.
E.g. if the array is [4, 1, 6, 8] and n=3, your function should return 4.

### Challenge

- Write binary search to find a given item in an array. You can write it yourself, or use this tutorial for some guidance: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/p/challenge-binary-search


### Check for Understanding

Make a cheat sheet answering the following questions for linear search and binary search:
- What is it?
- What types of arrays can you use it on?
- What is the runtime?
