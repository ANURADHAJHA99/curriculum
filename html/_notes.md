### Don't forget to teach
- paths can be relative - `<a>`, `<img>`, ...
- css multiple selectors for one set of styles (the stuff between the { and }) e.g. `a, p {`
- should we teach the `<table>` tag?
- once moving away from codepen, need to teach `<link rel="">` tag to include css



### Maybe teach
- `<style>` tag
- inline `style` attribute
