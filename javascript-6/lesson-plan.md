# Javascript-6: Object Literals

### Projected Time
About ___ hours
- ___ minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- ___ minutes for Independent Practice
- ___ minutes for ___

### Prerequisites
- "Javascript 1: Variables, strings & integers" lesson
- "Javascript 2:  Arrays & functions" lesson

### Motivation
- Object is the most important data structure in Javascript since in Javascript, any data that's not a primitive-type is an oject.  Utlizing objects allow us to store, look up, or change data efficiently.     

### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- create simple objects in Javascript
- Assign values to properties with both dot-notation and bracket-notation
- Change and delete object property-values

### Specific Things To Teach
- The concept of unordered property-value pairs
- Javascript's object syntax
- How to access data 
	- dot-notation 
	- bracket notation
- Object.hasOwnProperty()

### Supplemental Materials
- [Javascript Objects (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
- [Javascript Objects (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp)
- [Javascript property names (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_properties.asp)
= [Code.org video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZunUF_WGMb4)

### Mini Lesson

[JavaScript VI (slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2eDw84BqmcqvNDjtQfNEF_7PO91z-IHTR44QXt3-oI/edit#slide=id.p)

### Things to Remember
- If a properpty/key name is composed of multiple words, the convention is set them with camcel case, but if a property name with spaces is absolutely required, then use braket notation
- Accessing an object's value with dot-notation makes the code easier to read and requires less typing, but bracket-notation allows for dynamic accessing, for example, in a loop
- An object's values can be any data types, but its properties can only be strings, and Javascript will convert anything else to strings for property names
- Objects and arrays can be nested in complex ways
- All Javascript objects come with some default methods, such as .hasOwnProperty()
- Always avoid using reserved key words for property names

### Demonstration
Instructor demonstrates in the video walkthrough how to work with objects in JavaScript.

### Independent Practice  
//TODO: add independent practices

### Challenge
Google online for ways to loop through an object
- for-in / for-of
- Object.keys /Object.values
