### Languages
- HTML
- CSS

### Frameworks
Bootstrap

### Primary Goals
1. Linking to Bootstrap within a project
2. Adding Bootstrap components to a project
3. Receiving and incorporating constructive feedback on a project

### Overview
In this project you will create a well-designed webpage that displays one of your favorite recipes. It will include the ingredients, the steps needed to make the dish, links to similar recipes, and at least one photo.

Phase 1 of the project involves coding the structure of your webpage using HTML. This includes the ingredients, the steps needed to make the dish, links to similar recipes, and at least one photo.

Phase 2 of the project involves adding styling and pizazz using CSS. This includes changing the font style, font size, colors, and significantly altering the layout.

Phase 3 of the project involves incorporating Bootstrap. You'll add a navigation bar and several other Bootstrap components of your choosing.

Phase 4 of the project involves incorporating jQuery. You'll add at least one interactive element of your choosing.

### Context

### Basic Requirements
1. Properly link to the Bootstrap CSS CDN
2. Properly link to the Bootstrap JS CDN
3. Add a navigation bar to the top of your webpage
4. Add button to the bottom of your webpage
5. Make the button open a dialog box when clicked
6. Obtain a code review from Techtonica staff once you've fulfilled these requirements

## Setup Instructions
Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on [The Command Line Interface](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/command-line/command-line-interface.md) if you need guidance on using the Terminal.

When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/git-version-control/lesson-plan.md) if you need guidance.

1. Navigate to the `recipe-page` directory.  

If you have questions, do not disturb your colleagues until you have spent at least 20 minutes troubleshooting on your own. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/asking-good-questions/asking-good-questions.md) lesson.  


## Lab Instructions
