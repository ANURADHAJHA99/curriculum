Phase 4 of the project involves incorporating jQuery. You'll add at least one interactive element of your choosing.

### Context
- You've learned the basic structure of an HTML page
- You've learned the proper syntax for many commonly-used HTML elements
- You've learned how to open an HTML file in Chrome
- Let's put all these things together!

### Basic Requirements
1. Create an HTML file
2. Code the basic HTML structure
3. Add the title of the recipe
4. Add a brief background or blurb about the recipe
5. Add an unordered list of ingredients
6. Add an ordered list of the steps required to make the dish
7. Add at least one image
8. Add links to similar recipes you found online
9. Obtain a code review from Techtonica staff once you've fulfilled these requirements

## Setup Instructions
Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on [The Command Line Interface](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/command-line/command-line-interface.md) if you need guidance on using the Terminal.

When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/git-version-control/lesson-plan.md) if you need guidance.

If you do not yet have a directory called `techtonica-projects` on your Desktop, create one now using the Terminal. Initialize it as a git repository.

1. Navigate to the `techtonica-projects` directory.
2. Run the `git status` command. If you have any changes that need to be added and committed, do so before moving on. Make sure your branch is clean.
3. Create a new directory called `recipe-page` within the `techtonica-projects` directory.  
4. Navigate to the `recipe-page` directory.  

If you have questions, do not disturb your colleagues until you have spent at least 20 minutes troubleshooting on your own. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/asking-good-questions/asking-good-questions.md) lesson.
