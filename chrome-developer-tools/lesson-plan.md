- How to view a webpage's source code with and without Quick Source Viewer
- How to access the "Elements" tab to view a webpage's HTML and CSS
- How to access the JavaScript console to run and debug code
- Students will learn the various keyboard shortcuts to open CDT

### Materials

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- Websites are so mysterious! I can't find out how they're made. (You can, with Chrome Dev Tools!)
- All the source code I'll see using Chrome Dev Tools is good-quality code. (Most is, but not all!)
- I can just copy and paste whatever code I find using Chrome Dev Tools. (You could, but shouldn't you understand what it's doing first?)

### Instructor Demonstration
Instructor will demonstrate at appropriate points in the lesson slides how to access the various parts of Chrome Developer Tools that will be used during the Apprenticeship.

### Independent Practice

### Challenge
Students can explore inside Chrome Developer Tools and see what other functionality is has.

### Check for Understanding
- Students will make a cheat sheet for themselves of keyboard shortcuts they can use to open the various tools inside Chrome Developer Tools.
- Students will be given a webpage URL and will be asked to use Chrome Developer Tools to look at the code creating the webpage. They will need to answer questions about this code.
