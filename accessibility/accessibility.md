# Web Accessibility

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Motivation
As developers and designers, it's essential that we ensure the products we build can be used by anyone, regardless of different abilities.

### Objectives
**Apprentices will be able to**:
- Evaluate whether their website,app,or product is accessible with respect to visual, audio, motor, or cognitive impairments.
- Determine changes that can make websites more accessible.
- Implement those changes.

### Topics to cover
- What is accessibility?
- Why is it important?
- How do we design and build for accessibility?

### Mini Lesson

Try navigating a website with your keyboard only.
Start with www.trello.com. 

Things to pay attention to:
- How does it feel to navigate like this?
- Is it easy to accomplish your goals?
- Do you 

Next, navigate a website you use often (e.g. Github, Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn).
- Talk to a partner about what was easy, hard, or surprising.
- How would you make it better?
- What did they do that worked well?

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

Myth: Accessibility is just for people with disabilites
Fact: Accessibility benefits everyone using the web

Myth: We only need to consider color contrast when designing for vision impairments 
Fact: We also need to consider text size, line height, font,

### Independent Practice

- What are the main user goals/paths in your app?
- Are they accessible?
- How can you make them accessible?
- Write down three things you can do to make your app,or site more accessible.
- Commit to implementing those changes by a specific date.
