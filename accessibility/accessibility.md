### Motivation
Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people who experience disabilities.-Wikipedia. As developers and designers, it's essential that we ensure the products we build can be used by anyone, regardless of different abilities.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
- Evaluate whether their website,app,or product is accessible with respect to visual, audio, motor, or cognitive impairments.
- Determine changes that can make websites more accessible.
- Implement those changes.

### Topics to cover
- What is accessibility?
- Why is it important?
- How do we design and build for accessibility?

### Lesson

1. Read through the [a11y slideshow.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13ROF6Eq4sQwUMFOwDYQPxvCw-vhz5A-Q5gACalNXQyU/edit?usp=sharing)

2. Try navigating a website with your keyboard only.
Start with www.trello.com. 

Things to pay attention to:
- How does it feel to navigate like this?
- Is it easy to accomplish your goals?

Next, navigate a website you use often (e.g. Github, Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn).
- Talk to a partner about what was easy, hard, or surprising.
- How would you make it better?
- What did they do that worked well?
