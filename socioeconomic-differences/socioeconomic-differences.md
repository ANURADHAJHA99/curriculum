# Socioeconomic-differences

### Projected Time
    
	~30-50 minutes

### Prerequisites

    None

### Motivation
    
	A person's socioeconomic status can inform their identity, as it affects the community around them and their lived experiences. Therefore, there are some shared experiences among people who come from blue-collar backgrounds and move to white-collar jobs. The experience can be unsettling, and feel alienating at times, as it might be hard to understand a different workplace environment, and experience potentially negative responses from people around them. The purpose of this lesson is to help people recognize what might cause those feelings, and be able to address them when they arise.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
    
	- Anticipate certain pitfalls and aversions that come with belonging to a certain socioeconomic class
    - Learn the value of social capital and importance of asking for help from their fellow colleagues and seniors.
    - Learn that it’s normal for white-collar professionals to want reasons behind tasks and therefore one must not panic but rather give an appropriate reason for the   decision.


### Specific Things To Teach
    
	- The term "class straddler"
    - The value of social capital
    - The priority of networking
    - Accepting the difference and striving to work in order to achieve success.

### Lesson

    1. Spend atleast 3-6 minutes explaining the term " Class Straddler".

    2. Students can engage in an informative activity where the ones who identify themselves as "Class Straddler" can narrate the "good" and the "bad" experiences they have experienced so far.
   The following activity can help form base for the entire lesson.

    3. Take the note of the points mentioned by the students and include the points in further lesson. 
        Make sure to mention the following points:-
          -Amidst their transformation journey(from blue-collar job to white-collar job)students may struggle with white-collar tacts such as:-
	        -They may often feel out of place.
            -They may try to outwork themselves in order to "fit" amongst their workspace.
	        -Civil discussions about problems and solutions may feel like arguments.
	        -It can be hard to accept compliments.
	        -Their communities may scorn over their class straddling for it may be hard for them to accept the change too.
	        -((Other problems can also be added as the discussion with students is continued.))
	   

    -The reasons why they may feel aloof or "out-of-place" are:-
	   -Many such students support extended families as well.
	   -They have learned to live with isolation.
	   -They may not know the value of therapy.
	   -Generally people often dress, eat, and drink differently i.e everybody has a different cultural and social background.
       -They have scorned the rich and their lifestyle but now they are part of that atmosphere and it’s hard not to judge themselves or feel guilty.

 
   -However,it is the instructor task to emphasize that it is okay to feel so and simultaneously provide valuable solutions to the students.



### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

    Do not spend a lot of time explaining each point, rather try to fit the points effectively within the given time frame by explaining each points briefly but thoroughly,however try your best to include the suggestions and remarks made by students during the course of discussion.

 ###Guided Practice

    1. The participants may feel reluctant to initially share their experience.The instructor should try to encourage them kindly and carefully without asserting any obligation.

    2. The instructor can recount the examples of local professionals in the area,who too had blue-collar lifestyle but successfully transitioned to white-collar job.Also do mention the struggles they faced(however do not repeat or elaborate problems mentioned above, rather keep it more personal and healthy discussion).

### Independent Practice
    
	1.The students can further read articles,books,listen podcast or watch videos to enhance their understanding of the subject.
    
### Challenge
     
	1.Students can take a survey in their neighborhood(they can work in the group of 4), working places etc regarding people who identify themselves as "Class Straddlers" or people who have started working white-collar jobs after their previous blue-collar job and ask questions such as:-
	a.  What is the percentage of increase in their salary after the shift in the job?
	b.  What motivated them to change their profession?
	c.  What are the major differences they feel with the transition of profession or lifestyle?
    d.  Are they satisfied with the experience in their new work space?
	e.  What are the set of new skills that they had to acquire to get the white-collar job?
	f.  How did they learn the above mentioned skills?
	(Further questions can be added as suitable)
	The following data can be accumulated,with common reason binded together and thus the following data can be used to gain great deal of knowledge about the main issues,challenges and progress in their respective society.
    The following collected data can also be used for further assignment or data-science project.

	2.Students can work together to collect data to find which state in their country saw a major conversion of people from blue-collar job to white-collar job and what were the factors that was responsible, for e.g policies of their local government, increase of jobs due to sudden growth of offices in the areas, reason the offices were setup.  
   

### Check for Understanding

    1. A discussion can be held in the end where the participants summarize each other.
    2. Ask the students to read the first 30 pages of "Blue-Collar Roots, White-Collar Dreams" by Alfred Lubrano,and narrate the essence of what they have read and        understood so far.  
    3. Ask the students  specifically regarding the problems one faces in order to achieve promotion as "Class Straddlers".Ask them what they think are the appropriate measures to tackle the mentioned problems.
    4. Give assignment to the students to read atleast 2 short stories(try to assign the following assignment in group) from " Hillbilly Elegy " by "J.D. Vance" and ask them to explain the problems regarding "work ethics" as narrated in many of  the stories mentioned in the book and ask them to come up with solutions to tackle such issues.
