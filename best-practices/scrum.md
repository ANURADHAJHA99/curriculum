### Motivation

There is so much to learn, and practice everyday. Decision fatigue is a matter of fact, so, just why would you add another todo to your already long list of best practices? The reason why, is because Scrum is a lightweight and flexible framework based on Agile methodologies that compliment iterative delivery models known as sprints.
Practicing scrum will enable you and your team to instantly address change requests, and establish better connection between business and development teams. While this may not be a relevant experience at the moment, once you begin working you may observe that information silos between business and development teams are real. And, using Scrum promotes team morale, to offset the lack of communication, while introducing predictability and transparency when coupled with sprints. Not only that, using scrum will allow you to better predict the success of a project early on.

### Objectives

**Apprentices will be able to:**

- Understand what scrum means when the term is mentioned during a stand-up or conversation.
- Practice scrum
- Moderate a scrum session
- Know what a scrum master is 

### Specific Things To Teach

- Agile Ceremonies
- Agile Manifesto
- Anti-patterns - changing the sprint's scope after it has already begun.
- Keeping the scope air tight - subscribing adamently to the idea of not adding more to the sprint after the scope has been developed.
- Backlog
- Backlog grooming
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint
- Sprint planning
- Sprint retrospective
- Sprint review - Opportunity for stakeholders to give development team feedback or change requests.
- Stories - Idea of creating a ticket, or notecard for each feature request, technical debt or bug fix.
- Story points - Giving each item a rating of complexity from 1 to 5 to determine time and effort to complete
- Velocity - Measurement to quantify work completed using story points. Velocity gives teams the ability to predict the time to complete two weeks worth of work.

List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
