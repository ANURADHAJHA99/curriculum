# Adding Unit Tests to your NodeJS project

### Projected Time

Example: 30-45 minutes

### Prerequisites

Here are links to lessons that should be completed before this lesson:

- [Intro to Testing and TDD](testing-and-tdd.md)

### Motivation

Because unit testing tests the smallest possible segments of your code--and tests them independently of one another--if you break your code you should know exactly what is broken. This saves you the trouble of tracking down bugs. Although writing tests requires an upfront time investment, in the long run, you will write cleaner code more quickly.

Think about: it's not the most fun thing but if you pretend it's a puzzle it can be.


### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Compare and contrast unit tests and integration tests
- Explain the benefits of writing robust tests
- Write unit tests to test independent segments of their code
- Determine appropriate cases to test

### Specific Things To Teach

- Unit tests, integration tests, and what makes them different from each other
- Different testing libraries available for NodeJS and React
	- Jest
	- Mocha
	- etc.
- Expect vs. assert
	- Expect for independent test cases
	- Assert for dependent test cases
- Test Driven Development (TDD) vs Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

### Materials

- [Unit Testing Slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p7fa20o7lRyvXuXhsFz8MfHktY5MaqSPSrLdNjocNcE/edit#slide=id.p)

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:

- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- If you are confident in your code, it will save time to skip testing.
	- In the long run, testing will always save time. Even if you can't measure the time saved, you will understand your code better, which will make you a better, faster developer moving forward. Plus, you never know what might change in the future. Maybe your code will fall into the hands of another developer, and they won't realize they're breaking it. Maybe you will want to reuse a function in the future and you'll find you've forgotten exactly how it works. Looking at tests can help future you understand what past you was trying to accomplish.
- Example


### Guided Practice

Find an example of simple testing


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
