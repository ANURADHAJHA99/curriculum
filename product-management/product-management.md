- Introduction to product management (PM)
	- What is a PM?
	PM is a functional process to manage overall lifecycle of a product. The primary focus of Product Management is to build products that customers actually want. PM is a chief advocate for the user, mini CEO, primary influencer, the one that tells you what to build. A PM represents the customer, and they help make the customer awesome. No one buys a product because they want to give the company money. Customers buy and use products because the products address their needs: the products let the customers be awesome, and a PM ensures the customers can be great.
		- PM types: There are many different types of PM: some are techy, some are designy, some are businessy, it varies with type and stage of organization

		- Product Strategy Vision: 
		The PMs is responsible for setting a product business strategy and execution. They must first figure out who the customers are and what problems the customers have. Clearly articulate the business value and what intent behind the new product or product release. They own the strategy behind the product along with its roadmap and must work with engineering to build what matters. 
			- Responsibilities include: 
				- Create Product Vision - A good vision describes who the customers are, what customers need, and how you plan to deliver a unique offering. The vision includes details on the market opportunity, target customers, positioning, a competitive analysis, and the go-to-market plan.
				- Create Product Goals - Goals define what you want to achieve in the next quarter, year, or 18 months. Here are a few examples: Increase revenue by 30%; Expand into 5 new countries; Increase mobile adoption by 100%; Reduce the number of support tickets by 15%
				- Create Initiatives - Initiatives are the high-level efforts that will help you achieve your goals. Here are some examples: Performance improvements, UI improvements, Better reporting, Expand into China
			- PMs Approach: 
				Gather and analyze data
	    			Asking all the right questions
				Analytics
				User testing
		- Product Releases: 
		PMs must plan for what their teams will deliver and when they will deliver it. This holds true no matter which dev methodologies product teams use. The product manager owns the release aspect of product. 
			- Responsibilities include:
				Bringing it all together
 				Developing a plan
				Knowing when (and when not) to create a master release
				Managing features and dependancies in and across releases
				Managing releases with phases and milestones
		- Product Design:
		 Every organization wants better ideas -- but it is tough to manage and prioritize them. Product managers own ideation -- the creative process of generating, developing, and discovering new ideas. They collect, curate, and promote the most relevant ideas into features. They know which ideas should be promoted to features -- the ones that will achieve key objectives for the product line and business. They also ensure that key feedback and requests are seamlessly integrated into their product planning and development processes.
		 	- Responsibilities include:
 				putting flesh on the bones
 				making it real
		- Product Features:
		The product manager defines the features and requirements necessary to deliver a complete product to market and lead the product team to success. They are responsible for articulating the ‘what’ and working with engineering to determine the ‘when.’ 
			- Responsibilities include:
				Scope
				Work with development teams to make it into tangible stories
			
		-  Go-to-market: 
		The product manager is typically seen as the CEO of a product. For the product manager, this means they are responsible for making product decisions and often is the lead resource for the rest of the organization when deep product expertise is required. This includes supporting the organizations that help bring the product to market and work directly with customers -- namely marketing, sales and support.
			- Responsibilities include:
				99% of PMs life

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

This is something that students might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: thing


### Guided Practice

Have the students work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Students can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
