- Introduction to product management (PM)
	- What is a PM?
		PM is a functional process to manage overall lifecycle of software product or product-line. The primary focus of Product Management is to build products that customers actually want. PM is a chief advocate for the user, mini CEO, primary influencer, the one that tells you what to build. There are many different types of PM: some are techy, some are designy, some are businessy, it varies with type and stage of organization
	- What does a PM do?
	It depends on: product cycle, agile cycle, company stage
		- Product Strategy: The PMs is responsible for setting a product vision and strategy. Their job is to clearly 	articulate the business value to the product team so they understand the intent behind the new product or product release. They own the strategy behind the product along with its roadmap and must work with engineering to build what matters.
		- Product Releases: PMs must plan for what their teams will deliver and when they will deliver it. This holds true no matter which dev methodologies product teams use. The product manager owns the release aspect of product. Responsibilities include knowing when (and when not) to create a master release; managing features and dependancies in and across releases; and managing releases with phases and milestones.
		- Product Ideas: Every organization wants better ideas -- but it is tough to manage and prioritize them. Product managers own ideation -- the creative process of generating, developing, and curating new ideas. They collect, curate, and promote the most relevant ideas into features. They know which ideas should be promoted to features -- the ones that will achieve key objectives for the product line and business. They also ensure that key feedback and requests are seamlessly integrated into their product planning and development processes.
		- Product Features:The product manager defines the features and requirements necessary to deliver a complete product to market and lead the product team to success. They are responsible for articulating the ‘what’ and working with engineering to determine the ‘when.’
		- Go-to-market: The product manager is typically seen as the CEO of a product. For the product manager, this means they are responsible for making product decisions and often is the lead resource for the rest of the organization when deep product expertise is required. This includes supporting the organizations that help bring the product to market and work directly with customers -- namely marketing, sales and support.
