# Auth0 

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Prerequisites

Here are links to lessons that should be completed before this lesson.
- [Git version control](version-control/git-version-control/git-version-control.md)
- Know how to securely hide all your API keys in a ```.env``` file 


### Motivation
Auth0 makes it easy for clients to log in to your website through using their Gmail(or other types of social media accounts). It saves clients time from having to create a profile or remembering their password and they will love signing in to your website for that! 

### Objectives
Today I will be able to set up and integrate Auth0 with my final project. 

**Participants will be able to:**do something that we'll list here:
- Set up Google credentials 
- Connect Google credentials to Auth0 in Connections
- Create Auth0 application to download code files
- Integrate code files with project

### Specific Things To Teach
- Things about the things
- More things about the things
	- This is a sub-thing about the things
- Even more things about the things
- Even more things about the things

### Materials

- [How to get your Google Credentials API](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/google)
- [Create an Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com/)

Make sure to mention these things:

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

TWhen downloading the code from Auth0, do not incoorporate all of it onto your profile. There will be a section where we will go over what code is useful and what code is not necessary. 

Make sure they avoid this: 
- Avoid pushing your API keys to GitHub. Make sure you are keeping your information secured.



### Guided Practice

Step 1 - Set up Google credentials </br> 
Step 2 - Connect Google credentials to Auth0 in Connections </br> 
Step 3 - Create Auth0 application to download code files </br> 
Step 4 - Integrate code files with project

### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

If time permits and if you are up for the challenge, try uploading another social media account to verify with! 


### Check for Understanding

Have 2 apprentices log in to your website by opening a new incognito window that links to your project and having them go through the login process. The incognito window will make it easier for multiple people to log in without you having to log out of your gmail every time. Once your fellow apprentices are able to log in, you will be able to see their profiles on your Dashboard as follows: </br>
