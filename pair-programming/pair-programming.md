# How to Pair Program

### Projected Time
60 minutes

### Prerequisites
Professionalism lesson

### Motivation
Pair programming is a very common way to write code and solve software engineering problems. Pair programming generally produces higher-quality code: fewer bugs & better readability.

### Objective
**Students will understand**:
- What pair programming is
- Why pair programming is useful
- How to drive and how to navigate
- How to be a good pair partner
- Potential challenges

### Specific Things To Teach
- What pair programming is
- Why pair programming is useful
- How to drive and how to navigate
- How to be a good pair partner

### Materials
- [How to Pair Program slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vqPsNSpGbUAjIJgjhe7sYjYZfdeezE3VeTXqzKH9arw/edit?usp=sharing)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- "I could be doing this so much faster on my own." (Maybe, but you'd be missing out on a learn-by-teaching opportunity, and you might also have more bugs or weaknesses in your code)
- "Real programmers do not program in pairs." (Patently false. Plenty of companies ONLY write code in pairs!)
- "I don't know what's going on or what my pair is doing, so I'm just going to sit back and watch them." (Speak up and advocate for yourself. Ask questions and stay involved!)

### Demonstration
Two Techtonica staff members will demonstrate an effective, 10-minute pair programming session. 

### Independent Practice
[Pair Programming lab exercise](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/pair-programming/lab-exercise.md)

### Check for Understanding
During the lab exercise and the days following this lecture, Techtonica staff will observe each pair in 10-minute intervals and provide feedback.
