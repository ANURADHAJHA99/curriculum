### Things to Remember

- Interface design is often seen as the "visible things on screen". In fact, it is about the experience, but not just the experience using the app, it's about the whole user experience, including the one outside the app. Designers must immerse themselves into the user's mind and life.

- The iterative aspect of the design process is key. Designer motto: **The first design is never right**. A good designer always refines solutions and explores options.

### Independent Practice

Pairs will not be assigned for this exercise.

**Activity #1 - Design Improvements**
Pick an app or website whose UI or UX you dislike and make a list of things that could be improved.

Focus of the following:
- Am I able to complete the tasks for which the interface is built for? 
- Why would I **not** use the app on a daily basis? 
- Details matter. How is the copywriting? The app's personality? The visual language? The colors? The information density?
- List other annoyances you might see, hear, or feel

**Activity #2 - Design Successes**
Name something (an app, an object, an experience, a place) that you use regularly and that is truly making your life better. It doesn't have to be an application or software. 

Describe your feelings: Why do you use this in particular? Why not another something else?

What do you think stands out in terms of the following?:
- Emotional response
- Usefulness 
- Usability
- Simplicity
- Sense of community
- Speed

### Group Practice

Find a pair and share your findings for Activity #1 and Activity #2. Swap pairs and share once more.
