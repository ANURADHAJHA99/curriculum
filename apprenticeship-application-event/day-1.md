### Materials

- Use CodePen as your text editor for the tutorials below: https://codepen.io/
- [Railsbridge Frontend Lesson](http://docs.railsbridge.org/frontend/)
- [Railsbridge JavaScript To Do Lesson](http://docs.railsbridge.org/javascript-to-do-list/)

## Lesson
- Everyone will be paired with a peer as their 'coding buddy'.
- Create a codepen.io account, and take the tour of your codepen tools.
- Work through the [Railsbridge Frontend Lesson](http://docs.railsbridge.org/frontend/) first.
- You will then move on to building a guided project with Javascript: [Railsbridge JavaScript To Do Lesson](http://docs.railsbridge.org/javascript-to-do-list/).  You can finish to the section entitled 'Marking an Item as Complete' and stop there. We won't be doing 'Deploying your site' or 'Next Steps' at this event.
- Once about 2 hours have passed, you will have a chance to quickly present your progress on the To Do List Project (more on this soon).

## Guidelines
- **Show motivation and persistance**: Try to troubleshoot on your own, look through the resources below, or use google to find what you are looking for for *15 minutes* before asking for help. There's a very good chance you will find the answer on your own.  Also, researching and a strong desire to learn are skills essential to web development.
- **Communicate clearly and ask great questions**: If you take ownership of your problem and do some research first, you will have a much better idea of what you are specifically missing before asking your buddy for help. You don't have to know everything, so once you've tried on your own, accurately communicating your ideas and needs will get you far.
- **Be respectful and responsive to feedback**: Everyone learns differently, and being able to listen to your buddy's questions, responding thoughtfully, and receiving feedback with grace will be key to a good learning experience.  Everyone is a beginner at something, and in web development, you will be learning new things constantly whether you have been coding for 10 days or 10 years.

### Presentations

- At the end of 2 hours, you will be required to present the progress you've made in a lightning talk.
- You will have about 1 minute to present your idea. 
- Introduce yourself, and what drew you to coding and web development.
- Discuss your business idea, how you built your to-do list, and what difficulties you overcame to make it work.

### Independent Practice

You are encouraged to finish the tutorials before you come to Day 2 - you will need those skills to create a website of your own design!

### Extensions
If you feel you understand the contents of the Frontend and JavaScript tutorials, you can peek ahead at [Day 2](day-2.md).
