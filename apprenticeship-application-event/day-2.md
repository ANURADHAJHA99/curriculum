### Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Libraries
- jQuery
- JavaScript methods

### Projected Time
2 hours

### Primary Goals
1. Demonstrate understanding of basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
1. Demonstrate understanding of a few JavaScript data types, methods, arrays, iterations, and conditional statements.

### Overview
You are going to be able to apply your new skills from [the last workshop](day-1.md) into your very own web app.

### Context
- You will build a unique web app to demonstrate skills you learned on Day 1 of the Apprenticeship Application Events.
- You will build a fictional business homepage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, JavaScript methods, and jQuery using a codepen.io account.
- Your site should have at least a business name and description. The font, size, space and color styles should fit the type of business you've chosen.
- Your site will have a list.  This could be a list of items for sale, food on the menu, or events in the summer lineup.
- You will use the same list to print a random featured item, a newest/debut item, and a 1 or more specially chosen items that will be included in your site. Your list should be the only place the items names exist in your code, and you will access them using javascript functions.

### Basic Requirements
- [ ] 1. Use html & css to build a simple webpage on codepen
- [ ] 2. Adjust your javascript settings in codepen to accept jquery statements
- [ ] 3. Create a variable
- [ ] 4. Create an array
- [ ] 5. Use a ‘for loop’ to list the array items to append a menu/catalog/lineup to the webpage
- [ ] 6. Use the Math.random method to feature a random item to print on your page
- [ ] 7. Use the last item in your array as a newest or hottest item/event (the statement should work, regardless of array size)
- [ ] 8. Use an if statement to find and use at least 1 item in the array
- [ ] 9. Send your codepen site url to michelleglauser@techtonica.org at the end of the workshop, whether it is "complete" or a "work in progress".

## Guidelines
- **Show motivation and persistance**: Try to troubleshoot on your own, look through the resources below, or use google to find what you are looking for for *15 minutes* before asking for help. There's a very good chance you will find the answer on your own.  Also, researching and a strong desire to learn are skills essential to web development.
- **Communicate clearly and ask great questions**: If you take ownership of your problem and do some research first, you will have a much better idea of what you are specifically missing before asking your buddy for help. You don't have to know everything, so once you've tried on your own, accurately communicating your ideas and needs will get you far.
- **Be respectful and responsive to feedback**: Everyone learns differently, and being able to listen to your buddy's questions, responding thoughtfully, and receiving feedback with grace will be key to a good learning experience.  Everyone is a beginner at something, and in web development, you will be learning new things constantly whether you have been coding for 10 days or 10 years.
