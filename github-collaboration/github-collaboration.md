# Title Here

### Projected Time
About ___ hours
- ___ minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- ___ minutes for Independent Practice
- ___ minutes for ___

### Prerequisite
- Git version control lesson
- Git code storage lesson

### Motivation
In the industry, apps are created by teams of developerss so proper practice of Github collaboration is necessary to minimizes code conflicts.  

### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- create a repo branch
- create a pull request
- resolve a pull request

### Specific Things To Teach
- steps to create a new branch
- things to check when creating a new pull request

### Supplemental Materials
- [Github Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

### Mini Lesson
[Github collaboration (video walkthrough of slides)]
[Github collaboration (slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dGsFDog3uUq0XwVMCbYRJucPuzBWTFCawdas2r6fBdA/edit#slide=id.p)

### Things to Remember
- When working on a team project, NEVER push to the Github master branch directly from any of your local branch
- The best Github practices allow us to minimizes chances for merge conflicts (this happens when multiple people worked on the same file)
- When you do get a merge conflict, multiple people should sit down and resolve this either on Github or in Atom.
- In general, someone else should approve your pull requests to the master branch as to get an extra set of eyes.  

### Demonstration
Instructor demonstrates in the video walkthrough how to work with Regular Expressions in JavaScript.
