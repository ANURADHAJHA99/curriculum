# GitHub Collaboration

### Projected Time
About 1 hour
- 7 minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- 14 minutes for slides
- ___ minutes for Independent Practice

### Prerequisite
- Git version control lesson
- Git code storage lesson

### Motivation
In the industry, apps are created by teams of developers rather than individual people. Proper use of GitHub for collaboration minimizes code conflicts and helps teams work together.  

### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- Create a branch within an existing GitHub repo on their laptop
- Push that branch to GitHub
- Create a pull request, merging that branch into master
- Review a peer's pull request
- Resolve simple conflicts when merging a pull request

### Specific Things To Teach
- Steps to create a new branch
- Things to check when creating a new pull request

### Supplemental Materials
- [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

### Lesson

### Things to Remember
- If you mess up, you can usually undo what you just did. https://github.com/blog/2019-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git
- When working on a team project, NEVER push to the GitHub master branch directly. It's best to never commit directly to master as well.
- The best GitHub practices allow us to minimizes chances for merge conflicts (this happens when multiple people worked on the same file)
- When you do get a merge conflict, multiple people should sit down and resolve this either on GitHub or in Atom.
- In general, someone else should approve your pull requests to the master branch as to get an extra set of eyes.  

### Demonstration
Instructor demonstrates in the video walk through how to work with work with pull requests on GitHub

### Independent Practice  
- TODO, but rough sketch:
    - Create a GitHub repo with a few files in it
    - Apprentices clone the repo and modify one of the files
    - Create branch, commit, create PR
    - Instructor modifies base branch to cause a conflict
    - Apprentices resolve merge conflicts and merge their PRs

### Challenge
- TODO

### Check for Understanding
- TODO
