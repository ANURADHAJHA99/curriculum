## Cheat Sheet App:

There's an app that shows you a Keyboard Shortcut cheat sheet on a mac whenever you hold down the command key in most applications.  Note this will help with your command line app, but not the commands themselves. This app gets great reviews on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cheatsheet-2).

1. Download Cheat Sheet for Mac [here](https://www.cheatsheetapp.com/CheatSheet/). 
2. Install it, drag it into your applications, open it. 
3. Change the settings it recommends in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility.
4. Navigate to different applications and try holding down the command key for 2 seconds to see if it works!
