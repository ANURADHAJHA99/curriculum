# Command Line Interface

### Project Time

About ___ hours
- 25 minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- ___ minutes for Independent Practice
- ___ minutes for ______

### Prerequisites
- "How to Pair Program" lesson

### Motivation

For the layperson, who usually only opens and uses applications on their computer (MS Word, Internet, games, etc.) there isn't much need to use the Command Line. They can simply click on icons located on their Desktop or Dock. But for software engineers, who frequently interact with and send commands to the machinery inside their computers, the Command Line is a much more efficient way of using the computer's many capabilities. Even junior software engineers are expected to be proficient in using the Command Line for a variety of simple and intermediate tasks.

### Objective

**Students will be able to**
- Create a directory
- Navigate to a directory
- Add a file to this directory
- Change the name of the file
- Copy a file to a directory

### Supplemental Materials

- [BashGuide](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide)
- [Filenames and Pathnames in Shell: How to do it Correctly](https://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html)

### Accessing the Command Line ("Terminal")
1. Hold down the `COMMAND` key and press the spacebar once. This opens the OSX launcher, Spotlight.
2. When the search bar appears type "terminal" and press `ENTER` to launch the Terminal app.
3. The Terminal appears as a new window on the desktop and an icon in the dock.

	mkdir - make directory
	rmdir - remove directory
	grep - find things inside files
	cat - print the whole file
	man - read a manual page for a program
	env - look at your environment
	export - export/set a new environment variable

	chown -  change ownership

### Demonstration

Instructor demonstrates how to use many of the above commands in the video walkthrough of the lesson slides.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- Wrong directory
- Hidden files
- Ownership of directory / file permissions

### Independent Practice


### Challenge
