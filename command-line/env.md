### Lesson

![A basic .env file Example](./images/env-sample.png)

.env files are for project *environment variables*. These files often include sensitive data like:
	- API keys, which are private permission keys that allow you make a limited number of requests for data from sites like AllRecipes or GoogleMaps
	- Database URLs
	- All user authorization IDs and URLs, which you would need to set up OAuth, Okta, Auth0, etc.

Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
