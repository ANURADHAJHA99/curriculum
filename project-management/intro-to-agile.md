- break down a business case into tasks and stories 
- perform estimation in the stories and assign it to the agile board effectively 
- participate and lead a retro with a team
- explain why Agile became popular in the software development world

	- Simplicity is essential

- Common Methodologies
	- Pairing
	- TDD
	- Scrum, FDD, Kanban, ASD, XP, Lean

- Intro to stories and estimation
	- Think how to breakdown a problem to small pieces in order to solve it (ex. To-do list)

	- Intro to Sprints
	- Intro to Retros
- Scrum
	- Intro to Agile Board

### Materials

- Business case 
- Flashcards to create stories 
- [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum)
- Fruit

### Mini Lesson

Introduce the concept agile as a method with a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development. This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.

Open up the agile manifesto and discuss in class everyoneâ€™s understanding of it and introduce the principles and common methodologies.   

Share with students a business case that can be used to practice breaking down a problem and assign it to stories. 

Break into groups to form teams:

- Game: Story estimation intro
		- Have 4 fruits available, ask the class to provide an estimate of how much time it will take for an individual to eat each fruit (take notes of these estimates) 
		- Select two students from the group
		- Provide each student with 2 fruits
		- Select another couple students to keep track of the time 
		- Ask the selected students to eat each fruit as quickly as they can while time is being recorded
		- Compare results with the time estimated 
- Intro to story estimation
- Discuss business case and allow students to ask questions 
- Provide an example of how to break down the business problem to build stories 
- Ask students to came up with at least two stories 
- Break down into groups 
- Create an agile board per team 
- Assign the stories to the board
- Simulate a retro between the team members using an agile board 
- Discuss scrum 


### Common Mistakes/Misconceptions
- To-do list vs stories vs Agile methodology
- Waterfall methodology vs Agile methodology
- Agile doesn't mean you don't need to plan


### Guided Practice
- 

### Independent Practice
- Class continues creating stories based on the business case presented and adds them to their agile board.  
- Students practice estimate stories 
- Students identify different ways to perform a retro with the team (Google it and be creative!)

### Challenge
- As a homework, student should keep track on the different activities they perform from the time they wake up to the time they leave the house 
- Estimate how much time each task takes
- Perform a retro and encourage students to identify areas to improve efficiency vs unproductive time
