### Motivation
Deque is used as an abstract data type, also referenced as a dobule-ended queue.
Similar to a queue, deque's exist as an ordered collection of items. A dequeus nature is unrestrictive, meaning that it easily allows for adding and removing items at either end.Dequeus are a unique hybrid linear structure that provide the capabilities of stacks and queues in a unique data structure.Deques can be implemented with a dynamic array or with a doubly linked list and they do not require Last In First Out (LIFO) or FIFO (First In First Out) orderings that are required by both stacks and queues. Deque is also used as a verb meaning to remove from a queue.

### Objectives
**Apprentices will be able to** do something that we'll list here:
- Understand when to use a dequeu
- Be familiar with common methods
- Implement a dequeu
- Find and use a deque library
- Discern performance tradeoffs for different implementations of a dequeu

### Specific Things To Teach
- Properties of a dequeu
- Common use cases for dequeue
- Review of common implementation(s)

### Materials

- [Deque Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-set-1-introduction-applications/)
- [Deque Data Structure](https://youtu.be/5VDQxLAlfu0) - 2 minute video 

### Mini Lesson

Review content from slides (TODO: add link here when available).

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- There may be an implementation that is very simple, but untenable for larger queues.

### Guided Practice
Discuss as a group how a queue differs from other data structures already reviewed.  Some suggested questions to consider:
- What are the methods a queue must have?
- What can be tracked in a queue?
- When would a queue be used?
- What other data structures are used to make a queue?

### Independent Practice
Implement a dequeu in JavaScript, keeping in mind all methods and helper methods that define a dequeu. Consider performance -- what happens as you call specific methods you've defined?

### Challenge
There are many different ways to implement a dequeu in any language.  Implement a dequeu a different way from what you did before, then consider how it differs.  Is this second implementation better? If you get stuck, check out StackOverflow comments!

### Check for Understanding
Share what you've learned and your implementation with another person in the cohort.
