### Motivation
Trees are the type of data structure that will allow you to store and process objects and tasks dealing with numbers, strings and everything in between. The motivation here is to understand that a tree is a type of data stucture that represents data in a top down arrangement, similar to a hierarchy. Trees associate every object to a node in a tree, and the number of childre stemming from that node are referred to as its degree. There are several types of treees, including Binary Search Trees(BST) and with Binary Search Trees you can perform insertions, deletions, and retrievals. 


### Objective
**Apprentices will be able to** implement a tree.

### Mini Lesson

Coming up with algorithms requires creativity as well as an understanding of whether and how known techniques can be applied or modified. The effort needed to code an algorithm depends on the coding experience and the level of difficulty of the problem. Because of this, straightforward algorithmic tasks at times turn out to be a challenge to implement and debug. Trees area common interview question. They can be used when you want to store data that takes the shape of a hierarchy. Unlike arrays, and linked lists, trees are a non-linear data structure. Organizing keys in the form of a tree, allows us to serach a given key in less time than a linked list and slower than the time needed to search through an array. Self balancing search trees and Red-Black trees produce an upper bound of O(Logn)for search. Trees also provide a faster key insertion and deletion time when compared to arrays and a slightly slower time when compared to unordered linked lists.


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

This is something that students might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: thing


### Guided Practice

Have the students work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Students can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
