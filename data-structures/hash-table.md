# Hash Tables

### Projected Time
4 hours

### Prerequisites
JS
Runtime complexity

### Motivation
Hash tables are one of the most frequestly used data structures. You'll use them in your code a lot, so knowing how and when to use hash tables is important. 
Knowing how hash tables work will give you a deeper understanding of why hash tables are used and what they're good for.
Hash tables are also often used in the solution to interview questions.

### Objective
**Students will be able to:** 
- Know the runtime of hash table operations
- Be able to identify problems where hash tables could be used
- Be able to write code that uses hash tables to solve problems
- Understand how hash tables are implemented and how this implementation leads to the runtime properties

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

This is something that students might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: thing


### Guided Practice

Have the students work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

#### Coding questions that use hash tables

#### Implement a hash table
Basics: put(), get(), hash()

Challenge 1: Handle collisions with chaining

Challenge 2: Make the table larger when enough items are added to the table


### Challenge

Students can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
