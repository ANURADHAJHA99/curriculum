### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Prerequisites
JS
Functional programming

### Motivation
Stack is one of the most commonly used data structure along with its opposite relative, queue. Understanding how to implement stack helps you better understand and describe insertion, removal, and organization of data in a seqential order.

### Objective
Students will be able to explain what a stack data structure is and show how it is implemented

### Specific Things To Teach
- Definition of stack
- Show an example of stack data structure
- JavaScript methods use to implement stack

### Mini Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

Build on the first information. Have students guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:
- Things
  - This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

This is something that students might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: thing


### Guided Practice

Have the students work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Students can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
