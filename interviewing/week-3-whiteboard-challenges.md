## Whiteboarding Interview Challenges

### Languages
- JavaScript

### Tools
- A whiteboard or presentation paper 
- A personal repl.it account
- A timer

### Primary Goals
- Demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript basics and how to approach a whiteboarding challenge.

### Overview
In this project, you will write simple JS functions based on verbal prompts, in a whiteboard setting an on a computer. This will take about 90 minutes if you include setup and cleanup.

## Setup Instructions

### Part I:
- You will be assigned a partner.  You will swap roles as interviewer and interviewee.
- A whiteboard or presentation paper will feel the most like a real interview, especially if the interviewee is standing.  If you dont have these, a piece of paper and a pencil will work.
- Use a timer to make each interview 10 minutes long.
- The interviewer should observe, ask the interviewee why they are making certain choices, and ask leading questions if the interviewer gets stuck.
- Neither partner should read the prompt until that part of the challenge has begun.

### Part II:
- You will be assigned a NEW partner.  You will swap roles as interviewer and interviewee.
- The interviewee should open their repl.it account and open a new JS project to write their function.  
- Use a timer to make each interview 20 minutes long.
- The interviewer should have a good view of the screen and the code should be made big enough to be legible.
- The interviewee may google things, but they still need to talk through what they are looking for and why.
- The interviewer should observe, ask the interviewee why they are making certain choices, and ask leading questions if the interviewer gets stuck.
- Neither partner should read the prompt until that part of the challenge has begun.

## Project Instructions

#### Part 1 - 10 minutes of literal Whiteboarding.

- [ ] Once all of your materials are ready and you start the timer, the interviewer should read [this code challenge](https://gist.github.com/alodahl/f269d17027633387c6b5c04fdf8dd0b3) aloud to the interviewee.  (Neither person can peek until the actual interview!)
- [ ] Plan your solution before starting to code
- [ ] If there is confusion about the intention of the question, the interviewee should ask and the interviewer should decide.
- [ ] Describe the parts of the code you are writing, and the reasons for them.
- [ ] Test your function.
- [ ] Take a photo of your code before moving on.

After 10 minutes, partners should now switch roles. Set the timer for another 10 minutes, and the new interviewer should read [this code challenge]() aloud to the interviewee.

#### Part 2 - 20 minutes on a code editor with a new assigned partner

- [ ] Once all of your materials are ready and you start the timer, the interviewer should read [this code challenge]() aloud to the interviewee.  (Neither person can peek until the actual interview!)
- [ ] Plan your solution before starting to code
- [ ] If there is confusion about the intention of the question, the interviewee should ask and the interviewer should decide.
- [ ] Describe the parts of the code you are writing, and the reasons for them.
- [ ] The code should run.
- [ ] Test your function.
- [ ] Save the replit and save its url before moving on.

After 20 minutes, partners should now switch roles. Set the timer for another 20 minutes, and the new interviewer should read [this code challenge]() aloud to the interviewee.

### Part 3 - Submit your code

- [ ] Send the photo and URL of your own 2 interviews to the person who has agreed to review it.
