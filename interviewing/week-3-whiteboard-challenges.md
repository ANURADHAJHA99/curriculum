## Whiteboarding Interview Challenges

### Languages
- JavaScript

### Tools
- A whiteboard or presentation paper 
- A personal repl.it account
- A timer

### Primary Goals
- Demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript basics and how to approach a whiteboarding challenge.

### Overview
In this project, you will write simple JS functions based on verbal prompts, in a whiteboard setting an on a computer. This will take about 90 minutes if you include setup and cleanup.

## Setup Instructions

### For Part I:
- You will be assigned a partner.  You will swap roles as interviewer and interviewee.
- A whiteboard or presentation paper will feel the most like a real interview, especially if the interviewee is standing.  If you dont have these, a piece of paper and a pencil will work.
- Use a timer to make each interview 10 minutes long.
- The interviewer should observe, ask the interviewee why they are making certain choices, and ask leading questions if the interviewer gets stuck.
- Neither partner should read the prompt until that part of the challenge has begun.

### For Part II:
- You will be assigned a NEW partner.  You will swap roles as interviewer and interviewee.
- The interviewee should open their repl.it account and open a new JS project to write their function.  
- Use a timer to make each interview 20 minutes long.
- The interviewer should have a good view of the screen and the code should be made big enough to be legible.
- The interviewee may google things, but they still need to talk through what they are looking for and why.
- The interviewer should observe, ask the interviewee why they are making certain choices, and ask leading questions if the interviewer gets stuck.
- Neither partner should read the prompt until that part of the challenge has begun.

## Project Instructions

### Part 1 - 10 minutes of literal Whiteboarding.

- [ ] Once all of your materials are ready and you start the timer, the interviewer should read [this code challenge](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alodahl/f269d17027633387c6b5c04fdf8dd0b3/raw/d2947d2cb4e466a949f63c3858849b5c7090ba6d/Part%2520I,%2520question%25201) aloud to the interviewee.  (Neither person can peek until the actual interview!)
- [ ] Plan your solution before starting to code
- [ ] If there is confusion about the intention of the question, the interviewee should ask and the interviewer should decide.
- [ ] Describe the parts of the code you are writing, and the reasons for them.
- [ ] Test your function.
- [ ] Take a photo of your code before moving on.

After 10 minutes, partners should now switch roles. Set the timer for another 10 minutes, and the new interviewer should read [this code challenge](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alodahl/2f86ed0e231baf13be8c524352b34139/raw/18935fcd8bf5b0a1da030b68e94ed3a72e11bf29/Part%2520I,%2520question%25202) aloud to the interviewee.

### Part 2 - 20 minutes on a code editor with a new assigned partner

- [ ] Once all of your materials are ready and you start the timer, the interviewer should read [this code challenge](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alodahl/e3218836b5d469eb975d24be1791bc22/raw/4121fbc7869e7cf7987f045de9c0314a25427dba/Part%2520II,%2520question%25201) aloud to the interviewee.  (Neither person can peek until the actual interview!)
- [ ] Plan your solution before starting to code
- [ ] If there is confusion about the intention of the question, the interviewee should ask and the interviewer should decide.
- [ ] Describe the parts of the code you are writing, and the reasons for them.
- [ ] The code should run.
- [ ] Test your function.
- [ ] Save the replit and save its url before moving on.

- After 20 minutes, partners should now switch roles. Set the timer for another 20 minutes, and the new interviewer should read [this code challenge](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alodahl/609b94f5cf53cbc885afb96a80049fe4/raw/11f7f62d47bb122088ae45828cf1962218f40011/Part%2520II,%2520question%25202) aloud to the interviewee.

### Part 3 - Submit your code

- [ ] Send the photo and URL of your own 2 interviews to the person who has agreed to review it. Include the names of your partners for Part 1 and Part II.
- [ ] Take a break!  You've earned it.
