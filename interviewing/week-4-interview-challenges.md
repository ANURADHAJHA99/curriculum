## Week 4 Interview Challenges: Loops, Conditionals, Runtime Complexity

### Languages
- JavaScript

### Tools
- A personal repl.it account
- A timer

### Primary Goals
- Demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript Loops, Conditionals, If statements, Switch statements, and Big O Notation
- Practice interview situations

### Overview
In this project, you will write simple JS functions based on verbal prompts, in an interview setting on a computer. This will take about 90 minutes.

## Setup Instructions

### For Part I:
- You will be assigned a partner.  You will swap roles as interviewer and interviewee.
- Who is taller? That person will be the interviewee first.
- You should receive the first 2 interview questions via email at 9am, but dont open one until you start your interview!
- Use a timer to make each interview 20 minutes long.
- The interviewer should have a good view of the screen and the code should be made big enough to be legible.
- The interviewee may google things, but they still need to talk through what they are looking for and why.
- The interviewer should observe, ask the interviewee why they are making certain choices, and ask leading questions if the interviewer gets stuck.
- Neither partner should read the prompt until that part of the challenge has begun.

### For Part II:
- You will be assigned a NEW partner.  You will swap roles as interviewer and interviewee later.
- You should receive the second 2 interview questions via email at 10am, but dont open one until you start your interview!
- The rest of the instructions are the same as part one.

## Project Instructions

### These are the requirements for each interview:

- [ ] Once all of your materials are ready and you start the timer, the interviewer should read interview #1 or #3 aloud to the interviewee.  (Neither person can peek until the actual interview!)
- [ ] Plan your solution before starting to code
- [ ] If there is confusion about the intention of the question, the interviewee should ask and the interviewer should decide.
- [ ] Describe the parts of the code you are writing, and the reasons for them.
- [ ] The code should run.
- [ ] Test your function.
- [ ] Save the replit and save its url before moving on.

- After 20 minutes, partners should now switch roles. Set the timer for another 20 minutes, and the new interviewer should read interview #2 or #4 aloud to the interviewee.


### Part 3 - Submit your code

- [ ] Send the URLs of your own 2 interviews to the person who has agreed to review it. Include the names of your partners for Part I and Part II.
- [ ] Take a break!  You've earned it.
