# Assessment Objectives: A Grader's Guide

### How to Use
The files in the assessment-objectives folder each contain a checklist of the objectives for the apprentices' learning in the topics being assessed.

As an example, "0.md" contains the things apprentices should demonstrate in "Assessment #0". If an apprentice fails to demonstrate understanding, they should receive feedback from the grader that they need to put additional effort into meeting that objective.
