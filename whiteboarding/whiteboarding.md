# Whiteboarding

### Projected Time
45-60 minutes


### Prerequisites
Knowledge of a coding language and basic data structures and algorithms. An understanding of runtime complexity and how to optimize this is also beneficial, but not required before starting.

**Data Structures to Know**
- Arrays, Queues, Stacks, Linked Lists
- Trees (Binary Trees)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Heapify, Priority Queue)

**Algorithms to Know**
- Binary Search
- Quicksort
- Merge Sort
- Heapsort
- Depth First Search / Breadth First Search (Binary Tree)
- Building a Heap / Heapifying
- Building a Priority Queue

**Runtime Complexity**
- Constant: O(1)
- Linear: O(n)
- Exponential: O(2^n) or O(2^(n^k))
- Polynomial: O(n^2)
- Logarithmic: O(log n)
- N * Logarithmic: O(n log n)

**Recommended Languages**
(These languages are easiest to pick up and use for interviews. It is not necessary to know them all.)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- [Javascript](http://www.learn-js.org/)
- [C](http://www.learn-c.org/) / [C++](http://www.learncpp.com/)
- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) - for database queries
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - for frontend only
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - for frontend only


### Prerequisite
Here are links to lessons that should be completed before this lesson.
- [Data Structures](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/tree/master/data-structures)
- [Recursion](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/recursion/recursion.md)
- [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/algorithms/sorting.md)
- [Interviewing](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/interviewing/interviewing.md)


### Motivation
One of the most common types of technical interviews, is a whiteboarding interview in which you do not have access to the internet, a text editor, or notes, and cannot run your code. It is used to determine a candidate's ability to problem solve and break down difficult problems into smaller pieces.

It is helpful to practice brainstorming multiple solutions to a problem, talking through your thinking process, and considering runtime complexity before beginning to write any code. Whiteboarding is a challenging skill, that improves through practice!


### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- Verbally repeat the interview question in their own words, and break down the important parts to solve
- Write down important edge cases for the problem
- Brainstorm multiple solutions to the problem
- Discuss time/space complexity of proposed solutions
- Weigh pros/cons of different solutions and choose one of the methods to implement
- Write code on a whiteboard (with no internet or notes) to implement the solution
- Detect any potential bugs in the code (without a text editor)
- Verbally brainstorm potential optimizations or simplifications to the current solution


### Specific Things To Teach
- How to approach a whiteboarding problem
	- Verbally repeat the question
	- Write down edge cases
	- Brainstorm solutions
	- Discuss Time/Space complexity
	- Choose one solution, and write code to implement it
	- Verbally walk through your code using one of your edge cases as an example
		- Find and fix any bugs
	- Brainstorm optimizations/improvements
- How to practice whiteboarding with a partner
- How to practice whiteboarding at home (without a partner)
- Common interview questions/types
- Resources for finding more practice whiteboarding problems

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I need to write code down as quickly as possible, since I only have X amount of time to solve the problem."** Interviewers generally care more about how you approach technical problems, than about how quickly you can write code. Generally, brainstorming and making sure you think through any potential pitfalls at the beginning, will make writing the code much easier and faster.

- **"I must solve the problem completely on my own. My interviewers will think I'm a bad coder if I ask for help."** Interviewers have generally seen many people attempt to solve their problem. While directly asking for help may not be good, if you verbalize your current ideas, interviewers will generally guide you in the direction they want you to go.

- **"I know my first idea is a poor solution. I should keep it to myself until I think of a better solution, otherwise the interviewer will think I'm a bad programmer."** It's always better to mention your first few ideas for how to solve a problem, even if you think they may not be optimal. Verbalizing why they may not be optimal, shows the interviewer that you do understand time/space complexity and that you can think through edge cases.

- **"I don't think well verbally. I prefer to think inside my head, then share my final result."** Interviewers always prefer for you to think out loud, so that they can follow your thought process. Practice thinking out loud, and it will get easier!


### Demonstration

Two instructors will demonstrate an example whiteboarding interview, while explaining how they are implementing the whiteboarding strategies taught.


### Independent Practice

1. Techtonica staff will assign you a pair partner.

2. Decide who will be the interviewee and the interviewer first. Allot 30 minutes per partner to act as the interviewee.

3. Find a coding problem from one of the provided resources (or find your own). Make sure only the interviewer sees the question.

4. Have the interviewer ask the interviewee the whiteboarding problem.

5. Work through the problem with the interviewee at a whiteboard (or writing on a piece of paper) and explaining their thought process. The interviewer should practice asking questions about space/time complexity, finding potential problems with method/code, etc.

6. Once a solution has been implemented in code, the interviewee should walk the interviewer through an example edge case.

6. If the interviewee solves the problem and has extra time, practice brainstorming optimizations or other improvements.

7. Swap roles and repeat!


### Challenge

At home, talk through (out loud!) 2 whiteboarding problems a day. If you have have trouble with a problem (either here, or at home), continue working through the problem on your own without using the internet for the duration of the 30 minutes. After your 'practice interview' has ended, look up and understand other people's solutions, their pros/cons, and practice implementing them. The next day (or 2-3 days later), work through the same problem, with no internet/text editor and just a whiteboard.


### Check for Understanding

Create a coding-challenges project on your Github. Find coding challenges online, and type up your solutions (don't forget to include the questions!) into this repo. Push and save this code regularly to increase your github activity as well as practice solving coding problems.
