# Tech Industry Tips

### IRC/Other Help Channels

- Things move quickly and people get annoyed if you ask for permission before asking a question. It may seem really straightforward and possibly rude to you, but just ask the question. (No, "Can someone help me with a React question?" Instead, "This function is getting this error, and this is what I've looked up and tried so far. What am I missing?") 


### Email

- Make sure your email is set to automatically reply all so you don't leave people out, but when responding to a mailing list message
- If you get the same email repeatedly, set up a canned response to save yourself time.
- Don’t use Yahoo mail; people will judge you.
- Send links to Dropbox or Google Docs instead of clogging up people's inboxes with attachments.


### Slack

- @-mention people when resopnding to their messages in channels, or respond in a thread so they receive a notification (there are a lot of Slacks and the busiest people will appreciate that you brought them back to that conversation).
- Instead of writing, "Thanks," or "Got it," or, "Okay," use emojis (like a thumbs up) for short responses that don't add a lot of meaning to the messaging. 


### Twitter

- Starting a tweet with someone's user name will create a public message to that account rather than creating a really public tweet. If you want a tweet to be public but want to start with a user name, just put a . in front.


### Technologies

- Learn as many keyboard shortcuts as you can so mentors don't get impatient while watching you move back and forth between the keyboard and your mouse or trackpad.
- Don’t use Word or other non-cloud software for docs that others may need to edit. Use Google Docs.


### Professionalism

- Don't introduce people to each other without asking both sides for permission first.
- Don't use text-speak in your messaging. ("cu b4 the party" is a no-no.)
- Keep your LinkedIn updated with a good picture (you can use [Photofeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com/) to get other people's feedback).
- If you can't make it to an event you signed up for, let the organizers know.
- Connect with people you've met at events on LinkedIn within a week. Two days is better.


### Random

- It's generally a good idea to look in a shared drive or google something before asking someone.
