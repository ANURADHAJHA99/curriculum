# Memoization

### Projected Time

90 minutes

### Prerequisites

Here are links to lessons that should be completed before this lesson:

- [Runtime Complexity](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/runtime-complexity/runtime-complexity.md)

### Motivation

Learning memoization will help improve the runtime of your code which is a win for you and a win for your work.
The simple goal of memoization is to not waste time having your code do something is has already done. You can simply re-use the 
part of the code that was already run!

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Understand memoization 
- Recognize the benefit in runtime when using momoization
- Write code that uses memoization
- Explain the differences in runtime with memoization, tabulation and regular recursion

### Specific Things To Teach

- Things about the things
- More things about the things
	- This is a sub-thing about the things
- Even more things about the things
- Even more things about the things

### Materials

- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memoization-1d-2d-and-3d/)
- [Codeburst.io: Understanding Javascript Memoization in 3 Minutes] (https://codeburst.io/understanding-memoization-in-3-minutes-2e58daf33a19)

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:

- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

- Example
- Example


### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
