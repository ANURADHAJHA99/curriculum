### Things to Remember
- The advantage of working in milliseconds is that you are less likely to get an error from mishandling time zone conversion
- "Month" and "Day" of the week start at 0 
	- January is month 0
	- Sunday is day 0  
- Moment.js is the most popular framework to deal with all the date/time conversions.
