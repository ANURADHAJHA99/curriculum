# Level 1: Coding Challenge Assessments

## Goal

The goal of coding challenge level 1 assessments is to ensure you are able to use the JavaScript programming language to solve challenges on their own and are able to use constructs like:

* Function definitions
* Mathematical functions
* Return functions
* Loops

To solve programming problems they are faced.

## Challenges

### [Challenge] - Convert Inches to Meters

Define a function called `metersToInches` that takes an input of the number of meters and outputs the result of the number of inches.

**Hint:** `1 meter` equals `39.3701` inches.

#### Results

| input | value |
|---|---|
| metersToInches(0) | 0 |
| metersToInches(1) | 39.3701 |
| metersToInches(1.5) | 59.05515 |
| metersToInches(15.6) | 59.05515 |

### [Challenge] - Loop `n` Times

Write a function named `loopThrough` that takes an argument that is a number and loops through and displays a message *“Hello World”* that number of times.

#### Results

| input | value |
|---|---|
| loopThrough(0) | Nothing displayed |
| loopThrough(1) | Message displayed 1 time |
| loopThrough(3) | Message displayed 3 times |

### [Challenge] - Number sum

Define a method called `calculateSum` to calculate the sum all the digits from 0 to an input number.

| input | value |
|---|---|
| calculateSum(0) | 0 |
| calculateSum(1) | 1 |
| calculateSum(3) | 6 |
| calculateSum(10) | 55 |

### [Challenge] - FizzBuzz

Write a function called `fizzbuzz` that prints each number from 1 to the input on a new line. 

* For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
* For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.


#### Results


```
fizzbuzz(0)
```

Will result in the following (no) output:

```
```

```
fizzbuzz(16)
```

Will result in the following output

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
```

### [Challenge] Calculate Factorial Number

A factorial number is the concept in math by value of multiplying numbers by each consecutively smaller number. 

For example, the value of `3` factorial, is `6`, which can be calculated by:

```
3 * 2 * 1
```

The value of `10` factorial, for example, can be calculated by:

```
10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
```
