### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- "I can't ask for help because I should know how to do everything on my own."
- "No one has ever been stuck on this thing I'm stuck on, and therefore no one will be able to help me."
- "I tried searching for this on Google but nothing came up. There's no other way for me to make progress on this."
- Calling someone over to your screen and asking, "What's wrong with my code?"
