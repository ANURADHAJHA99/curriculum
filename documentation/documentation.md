# Documentation

### Projected Time
45-60 minutes

### Prerequisites
Knowledge of what HTML, CSS, and Javascript code looks like

### Motivation
- To be able to effectively add comments to your code, either for your own reference or for collaborators.
- To be able to efectively write documentation for a project you're working on, in order to tell or show others how to use it.

### Objective
**Students will be able to** 
- Add useful comments to their code
- Write useful, easy-to-follow documentation

### Specific Things To Teach
- Inline comments in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- How to read documentation
- How to write documentation

### Materials
- [Reading & Writing Documentation lesson slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18CJBM1Z6IA4MGGy6phf2bJN5gOrzQ64y1coIMcq8te0/edit?usp=sharing)

### Mini Lesson
Comments have been around as long as code. They exist to fill the gap between the information presented by variable names, function names, and formal documentation.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- Make sure your comments will make sense to someone with little context for what you were trying to do at the time you wrote the code.

- It's tempting to make "note-to-self"-style comments, especially early in a project. But both future collaborators and your future self will be grateful if you're very clear from the start.

- Comments should document the present and occasionally the future, but they should not be used to describe history. That's what version control is for.

- Don't use bad words in comments.

### Guided Practice
We'll look at a JavaScript code snippet together and talk through it line-by-line. We'll then change some of the variable names and function names to make them more descriptive. We'll add a couple comments to explain other things. 

### Independent Practice
[Comments & Documentation lab exercise](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/documentation/lab-exercise.md)

### Check for Understanding
Instructor does a verbal pop quiz of when to use comments vs. when to create better variable names.
