### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- "This is irrelevant to me right now because I'm an apprentice. I'll start acting professionally once I'm hired." Many serious athletes "practice like they play", meaning they approach their practice and training with as much seriousness and intensity as they'd put in during a real game. This makes them well-prepared for game days. Techtonica has a similar approach, and we expect apprentices to "practice like they play".
- "If someone tells me to behave professionally, they are telling me to act more like an higher-income white person." If someone tells you to behave more professionally, they are referring to the (sometimes unwritten) behaviors outlined in this lesson. These behaviors are generally accepted across industries, roles and employment types to be "professional".
- "Behaving professionally makes me appear weak." Behaving professionally demonstrates that you value your role, your team, your employer and are conscientious.
- "I cannot be my authentic self and behave professionally." Being yourself and behaving professionally are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes, the "professional" you is one part of your true self who gets to come out at work, while other parts of your true self get to come out at other times. 
- "It won't matter what I do or how I act because I'll just be a junior software engineer after Techtonica." Junior software engineers are valued team members and are held to the same standard of professionalism as everyone else at the company. Behaving professionally demonstrates that you value your role, your team, your employer and are conscientious. Start your reputation off on good footing.
