### Motivation


### Objective
**Students will be able to** do something that we'll list here:
- Things
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things

### Specific Things To Teach
- Set goals for new connections, maybe compete with friends.
- Names should be written as clearly and big as possible on name tags at events to avoid awkward squinting.
- Add pronouns to your name tag if you think that'll make it easier for people.
- Make a second name tag that says, "Ask me about _____."
- Wave at people you know and then either avoid them completely or take them along with you to meet new people.
- When you learn a new name, take the time to really learn it by thinking of someone else with a similar name or something that rhymes with it, etc. No one is really "bad at names."
- [The Pac-Man rule](http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/)
- Don’t be afraid to walk up to people and introduce yourself to them. They’ll probably be glad you made it easier for them to meet more people.
- If you get stuck in a conversation at a networking event:
	- Stick out your hand and shake the person’s hand or touch their arm while saying, “It was great meeting you.” 
	- Say, “Let’s mingle some more,” and walk away. 
	- Say, “I see someone I need to talk to.”
