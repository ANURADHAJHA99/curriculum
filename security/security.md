### Projected Time

### Motivation


### Objective
**Students will be able to** do something that we'll list here:
- Things
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things

### Specific Things To Teach
- Things about the things
- More things about the things
	- This is a sub-thing about the things
- Even more things about the things
- Even more things about the things

### Materials

- [OWASP Top 10 Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Cheat_Sheet)
- [OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide](https://www.owasp.org/images/0/08/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf)

### Mini Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

Build on the first information. Have students guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things: 
- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

This is something that students might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: thing


### Guided Practice

Have the students work with you as you do something. 


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

There are a few XSS web games that are well-suited to self-study, but may be helpful to start with an instructor. [Google](https://xss-game.appspot.com/) and [Excess XSS](http://excess-xss.com/) are fun.
If they express a strong interest in red teaming, they can experiment with a [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) VM and read about its rich FOSS tool suite.


### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
