## Techtonica Curriculum 

This repository consists of the curriculum of Techtonica, a free tech training and job placement program for low-income women and genderqueer adults. If you want to contribute, please make sure you edit this README so the Table of Contents below links to your new files. While this curriculum is open-source, we hope you'll use it to help underprivileged groups and groups underrepresented in the software industry.
