### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- "I only have one learning style."
- "I'm not good at learning new things because I didn't get good grades in school."
- "As long as I have a growth mindset, learning new things will be easy."


### Demonstration
**Instructor will demonstrate**:
- Taking the Learning Styles quiz
- Setting a timer for the Pomodoro method
- Taking the Growth Mindset quiz

### Group Activity

Instructor will lead class through an exercise to write down some positive, affirmative things to say to oneself that fall under the framework of the growth mindset. 

Example: "I'm having difficulty absorbing this concept, but I have a lot of resources I can use to try coming at this from a different angle."
