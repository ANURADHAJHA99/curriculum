## Developer tools

In order to start coding on your own computer, you'll need a text editor that saves files without rich text formattingâ€”no bold words or fancy fonts allowed. You'll also need a command line interface for running your programs. And finally, you'll need to install an interpreter, which is a program that runs your program.

# Goals

- [ ] Install Sublime Text
- [ ] Edit a file using Sublime Text
- [ ] Customize preferences in Sublime Text

- [ ] Install Sublime Text and customize it with `translate_tabs_to_spaces`
- [ ] Create a Python program that prints out your name
- [ ] Run your program with `python my_name.py`
