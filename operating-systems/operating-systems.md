# Operating Systems

### Projected Time

30-45 minutes

### Motivation

There are lots of OSes. You need them to run your computer. Different people use them for different things.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

-   Describe the role of the operating system on a computer or other device
- 	Distinguish between the user interface of an OS vs of software
- 	Do commands like Delete and Move
-		Create an analogy to describe processes, threads, and context-switching

### Specific Things To Teach

-		Relationship between software, OS, and hardware
- 	Processes and threads
-		Types of memory
- 	Users and groups



### Materials

-   [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)
-   [Linux from Scratch](http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/read.html)
-   [Architecture of Windows NT - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions


- **"Any operating system can run any piece of software."** This is false

- **"An operating system can only run one process at a time."** This is false

- **"Something about permissions."** One network or machine can have many users. Different users can have different amounts of access.

### Guided Practice

Do all of the following using only the terminal. Commands may vary slightly depending on the OS you are using.

- Create a new user.
- Create a new group called `example`.
- Add the new user to `example` group.
- Create a new file.
- Change the ownership of the file so that it belongs to the new user.



Create a user. Add it to some groups. Create a file. Change the ownership and try to do things with it.

### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.

### Challenge

Participants can try to do this other thing.

### Check for Understanding

Have participants summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
