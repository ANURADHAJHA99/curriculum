# Javascript 7 - RegEx

### Projected Time
About ___ hours
- ___ minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- ___ minutes for Independent Practice
- ___ minutes for ___

### Prerequisites
- JS 1 lesson
- JS 2 lesson
- JS 3 lesson
- JS 4 lesson

### Motivation
- Regular Expression patterns are shortcuts for string manipulations that allow programmers to type much less code

### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- Read RegExps in Javascript
- Use RegExps to test and replace strings

### Specific Things To Teach
- JavaScript's RegExp syntax/structure
- How RegExp modifiers work
- The 4 string methods and 2 RegExp methods that work with RegExps

### Supplemental Materials
- [Javascript Regular Expressions (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
- [Javascript Regular Expressions (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp)
- [JavaScript RegExp Reference (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp)
- [RegExp (Eliquent Javascript)](https://eloquentjavascript.net/09_regexp.html)

### Things to Remember
- Javascript RegExps are objects! 
- There are two ways to use RegExps: 
	- RegExp as input to 4 String methods: String.replace(), String.match(), String.search(), String.split()
	- String as input to 2 RegExp methods: RegExp.test(), RegExp.exec()
- You can add modifiers to RegExps
- The pattern goes between the two forward slashes, and you can use back slashes to escape special characters
- There are a lot of complex RegExp patterns, so it's best olearn them as you go.
