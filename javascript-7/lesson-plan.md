# Javascript 7 - Regular Expressions / RegExp

### Projected Time
About ___ hours
- ___ minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- ___ minutes for Independent Practice
- ___ minutes for ___

### Prerequisites
- JS 1 lesson
- JS 2 lesson
- JS 3 lesson
- JS 4 lesson

### Motivation
- Regular Expressions allow you to search and modify strings using a special language. They are very powerful and can enable writing significantly less code.

### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- Read RegExps in Javascript
- Use RegExps to test and replace strings

### Specific Things To Teach
- JavaScript's RegExp syntax/structure
- How RegExp modifiers work
- The 4 string methods and 2 RegExp methods that work with RegExps

### Supplemental Materials
- [Javascript Regular Expressions (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
- [Javascript Regular Expressions (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp)
- [JavaScript RegExp Reference (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp)
- [RegExp (Eliquent Javascript)](https://eloquentjavascript.net/09_regexp.html)

### Things to Remember
- Javascript RegExps are objects! 
- There are two ways to use RegExps: 
	- RegExp as input to 4 String methods: `String.replace()`, `String.match()`, `String.search()`, `String.split()`
	- String as input to 2 RegExp methods: `RegExp.test()`, `RegExp.exec()`
- You can add modifiers to RegExps
- The pattern goes between the two forward slashes, and you can use back slashes to escape special characters
- There are a lot of complex RegExp patterns, so it's best to learn them as you go.  

### Demonstration
Instructor demonstrates in the video walk through how to work with Regular Expressions in JavaScript.

### Independent Practice  
- Can you create a regular expression to match words ending with `tonica`? Test it out.
- What about a regular expression for all even-length strings?
- Can you write a regular expression that replaces all instances of `symantec` with `semantic`?
- What about a regular expression that deletes all words that end in `ing`?

### Challenge
- Write a regular expression that matches any of the Techontica participants names.
