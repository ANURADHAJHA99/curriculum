	- Examples of thought-through, well-designed experiences, objects and interfaces 
	- Why are they good?
	- The innovation challenge: a balance between new solutions and common patterns
- Definition of UX design applied to interfaces
- Definition of UI design (sometimes called visual design)
- The design process: from user research to development
	- User flows, scenarios, edge cases, patterns, personas, accessibility... The vocabulary of UX/UI

### Mini Lesson

Name something (an app, an object, an experience, a place) that you use regularly and that is truly making your life better. It doesn't have to be an application or a software. 

Describe your feelings: why do you use this one? why not another one?

How would you say it stands out:
- Emotional response
- Usefulness 
- Usability
- Simplicity
- Sense of community
- Speed
- ...

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

Interface design is often seen as the "visible things on screen". In fact, it is about the experience, but not just the experience using the app, it's about the whole user experience, including the one outside the app. Designers must immerse themselves into the user's mind and life. Take the example of Uber: at Uber, designers work on the experience inside the app, but they **must** think about everything around it: from the moment the user is making the decision to book an Uber, to the moment they're waiting on the sidewalk, to the moment they meet their driver, to the moment they reach their destination, to the moment they tip the service.
Students must understand all the underlying aspects of interface design. 

Also the iteration aspect of the design process is key. Designer motto: **the first design is never right**. A good designer always refines solutions and explores options.

### Guided Practice

Think of a device or an object that would improve the user experience of a Formula 1 pilot. 

### Independent Practice

Pick an app or website you recently disliked and draw a comprehensive list of things they could have done better.

Focus of the followings:
- Am I able to complete the tasks for which the interface is built for? 
- Why would I not use the app on a daily basis? 
- Details matter: how is the copywriting, the app personality, the visual language, the colors, the information density?
- List other annoyances you might see, hear, or feel

### Challenge

The city of San Francisco is currently trying to improve its communication with its population. Build a simple, accessible service that would allow both ends to interact more efficiently. Remember: the first design is never right, emphasize on the fundamentals.
