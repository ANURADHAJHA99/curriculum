# JavaScript 3

### Projected Time
About ___ minutes
- ___ minutes for the video walkthrough
- 
- 

### Prerequisites
'JavaScript 2" lesson

### Motivation
JavaScript is used on the frontend of almost every website. It's also a widely-used scripting language that be used on the backend as well. The JavaScript lessons set a solid foundation in JavaScript basics so we can use the language in more robust ways in later lessons.

### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- Make comparisons of equality and value
- Determine the Boolean value of a given comparison
- Write a conditional control flow using `if`, `else if` and `else` statements
- Implement logical operators `&&`, `||` and `!`

### Specific Things To Teach
- Comparison Operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`)
- Boolean values (`true`/`false`)
- Conditional (`if`/`else if`/`else`) statements
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)

### Things to Remember

- **Booleans are not strings.** Booleans (`true` and `false`) are their own data type. If you wrap quotes around a Boolean (`"true"` and `"false"`), it is no longer a Boolean, it is a string.

- **In JS, almost always use `===` when assessing equality.** Using `==` will sometimes cause problems because JS can force a data type to be changed.

- **Pseudocode is incredibly helpful for organizing your thoughts and planning what code you will write.** Use it freely!


### Demonstration

Instructor demonstrates in the video walkthrough how to work with equality, Booleans, if/else and logical operators in JavaScript.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Students can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
