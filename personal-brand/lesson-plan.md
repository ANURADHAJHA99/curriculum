  - Join a community
- Make Friends
  - Get involved on Twitter and GitHub
- Share your experience
  - Blog

  - Speak

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

This is something that students might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: Most new developers feel they need to be an expert at something before they can share on a topic. The irony is there is a not a lot of free beginner content out there for new developer geared towards new developers and the same new deveopers are in the best position to teach each other today. No matter how new you are, there is someone who knows less than you and you are in the best position to teach them.


### Guided Practice

Visit [templates.netlify.com](http://templates.netlify.com/) and select a template. Review the documentation how the netlifycms.org works. 

### Independent Practice

Take some time this week to write a blog post on something you learned this week. Before posting to the world have a fellow classmate review it to see if the information is useful. Once confirmed useful, ship it and continue this process at least once a week. Remember to keep the blog post short at first to prevent writers block and anxiety about posting. 

### Challenge

Tweet out about your new blog on Twitter using the #codenewbie hashtag. 

### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
