# JavaScript 5

### Projected Time
About 90 minutes
- 10 minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- 75 minutes for Independent Practice

### Prerequisites

"JavaScript 3" lesson

### Motivation
JavaScript is used on the frontend of almost every website. It's also a widely-used scripting language that be used on the backend as well. The JavaScript lessons set a solid foundation in JavaScript basics so we can use the language in more robust ways in later lessons.

### Objective
**Apprentices will be able to**
- Know when to use a switch statement instead of an if/else statement
- Write a switch statement using proper syntax

### Specific Things To Teach
- when to use a switch statement
- switch syntax

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **You need a `break` statement at the end of each `case`.**

- **There is no comparison operator in a switch statement, but there is one in the if/else statement**


### Demonstration

Instructor demonstrates in the video walkthrough how to work with numbers and strings in JavaScript.


### Independent Practice

Techtonica staff will assign pairs.

**Activity #1**  
Complete [this HackerRank challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/7days-javascript/challenges/js-switch-statements) which deals with a simple switch statement.

**Activity #2**  
Refer back to the calculator activity from the JavaScript 1 lesson. Refactor your code to replace your if/else statement(s) with switch statement(s).

**Activity #3**  
Refer back to the movie night activity from the JavaScript 3 lesson. Refactor your code to replace your if/else statement(s) with switch statement(s).
