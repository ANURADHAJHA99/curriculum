# JavaScript 6: Object Literals

### Projected Time
- 15 minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- 180 minutes for Independent Practice


### Prerequisites
- JS 1 lesson
- JS 2 lesson

### Motivation
- Object Literals are the most robust data type in JavaScript (and many other modern programming languages). Object literals allow us to store, look up, and change data efficiently.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
- Create Object Literals in Javascript
- Understand property-value pairs
- Assign values to properties with both dot-notation and bracket-notation
- Change the value associated with a property
- Delete property-value pairs

### Specific Things To Teach
- JavaScript's Object Literal syntax
- The concept of unordered property-value pairs
- How to access an Object Literal's data 
	- With dot-notation 
	- With bracket notation
- `Object.hasOwnProperty()`

### Supplemental Materials
- [Javascript Objects (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
- [Javascript Objects (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp)
- [Javascript property names (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_properties.asp)
- [Code.org video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZunUF_WGMb4)
- [Eloquent Javascript, The Secret Life of Objects ](https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html)

### Lesson
[JavaScript VI (slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2eDw84BqmcqvNDjtQfNEF_7PO91z-IHTR44QXt3-oI/edit#slide=id.p)

### Things to Remember
- If a property name is composed of multiple words, the convention is to use CamelCase. 
        -If a property name with spaces is absolutely required, then you'll only be able to use braket notation to access it's associated value. You won't be able to use dot-notation.
- Accessing the value of an Object Literal's properties with dot-notation makes the code easier to read and requires less typing. But bracket-notation allows for dynamic accessing, like what you do when you use a loop
- An Object Literal's values can be any data type, but its properties can only be strings
- Object Literals can be nested in complex ways
- All Object Literals come with some default methods, such as `.hasOwnProperty()`
- Never use reserved keywords for property names (like `function`, `var`, `switch`, etc.)

### Demonstration
Instructor demonstrates in the video walkthrough how to work with Object Literals in JavaScript.

### Independent Practice 
TBD during instruction. Hang tight!

### Check for Understanding
Create a cheet sheet for yourself based off reading Eloquent Javascript and upload to GitHub.
