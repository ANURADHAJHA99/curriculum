# Basic JavaScript Practice


## Goal

The goal of Basic JavaScript Practice is to ensure you are able to use the JavaScript programming language to solve challenges on your own and are able to use constructs like:

* Function definitions
* Mathematical functions
* Return functions
* Loops
* Objects
* Runtime Complexity

To self-assess understanding of concepts.  

## Directions
- Complete each Challenge in seperate repl.it or codepen.io project, and save the links all together in a document so you and your mentor can access them easily later. 
- Before next week begins, weaker concepts should be reviewed, discussed with peers, and if there is still confusion, discuss with your mentor.

## Challenges

### [Challenge 1] - Convert Inches to Meters

Define a function called `metersToInches` that takes an input of the number of meters and outputs the result of the number of inches.

**Hint:** `1 meter` equals `39.3701` inches.

#### Results

| input | value |
|---|---|
| metersToInches(0) | 0 |
| metersToInches(1) | 39.3701 |
| metersToInches(1.5) | 59.05515 |
| metersToInches(15.6) | 59.05515 |

### [Challenge 2] - Loop `n` Times

Write a function named `loopThrough` that takes an argument that is a number and loops through and displays a message *“Hello World”* that number of times.

#### Results

| input | value |
|---|---|
| loopThrough(0) | Nothing displayed |
| loopThrough(1) | Message displayed 1 time |
| loopThrough(3) | Message displayed 3 times |

### [Challenge 3] - Number sum

Define a method called `calculateSum` to calculate the sum all the digits from 0 to an input number.

| input | value |
|---|---|
| calculateSum(0) | 0 |
| calculateSum(1) | 1 |
| calculateSum(3) | 6 |
| calculateSum(10) | 55 |

### [Challenge 4] - FizzBuzz

Write a function called `fizzbuzz` that prints each number from 1 to the input on a new line. 

* For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
* For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.


#### Results


```
fizzbuzz(0)
```

Will result in the following (no) output:

```
```

```
fizzbuzz(16)
```

Will result in the following output

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
```

### [Challenge 5] Calculate Factorial Number

A factorial number is the concept in math by value of multiplying numbers by each consecutively smaller number. 

For example, the value of `3` factorial, is `6`, which can be calculated by:

```
3 * 2 * 1
```

The value of `10` factorial, for example, can be calculated by:

```
10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
``` 

### [Challenge 6] Switch Statements



### [Challenge 7] Determine Runtime Complexity

At the top your document for each challenge, state the runtime complexity for that function.
