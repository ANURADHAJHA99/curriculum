# API Basics

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Motivation
To dive deep into RESTful APIs and build a project using a REST API. 


### Objective
**Students will be able to** Identify the components of a RESTful API, read documentation, and use code samples to incorporate the API's features into their own projects.

### Specific Things To Teach
- Constraints
- HTTP Verbs/Response codes
- Authentication/API Keys

### Materials

- [REST Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA)
- [Resource from Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/api-basics/s)
- [Resource from Zapier](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/)

### Mini Lesson

You can build apps that grab specific information about demographics, interaction, and engagement and share the data in a unique way. 

REST APIs help you to fetch and post data in your app, and there are a wealth of APIs that exist for your creative use. 



### Guided Practice

Use the Facebook Graph API (as shown in the video) to query for data. Have students participate by setting parameters for you to use. 


### Independent Practice

Build a CodePen using the [TwitchTv API.](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)


### Challenge

Expand your CodePen by adding three more user stories and addressing them.


### Check for Understanding

Add an additional user story and address it in your CodePen. Explain to a classmate what your Codepen is looking for and how the user story is addressed.
