## Project Title  

### Languages
- Lang1
- Lang2

### Frameworks
- FW1
- FW2

### Primary Goals
1. Include the SWBAT/AWBAT to here.
Each project's primary learning outcomes should directly reflect the SWBAT for each and every Topic that is covered with the project. For example - the second project for the apprentices is Front End Fundamentals(FEF's). FEF should include all the SWABT's for HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. So, I will incude them below, so you get the idea:

## HTML & CSS 
- Write semantic markup using `<html> <head> <title> <body> <h1-6> <p> <ul>/<ol>/<li> <code>`
- Use `<a>` and `<img>` and explain the difference between a tag, tag name, tag attribute, and the content contained by the tag
- Add structure to a site using `<div> <span> <nav>` and use CSS selectors to style different sections differently
- Write CSS selectors that target a specific tag
- Change the color, background-color, font, font-size, text-align, cursor
- Select HTML elements using the type, .class and #id CSS selectors
- Explain the difference between classes and ids
- Explain what CSS properties and CSS values are, and how they're related
- Describe the 3 ways that CSS code can be incorporated into a project 
- Sketch the basic file tree for web projects 
- Describe several text properties that can be altered using CSS
- Describe how borders can be styled using CSS
- Describe the hierarchy of specificity for CSS selectors
- Describe the different parts of the "Box" model
- Effectively use the display property

## Bootstrap
- Incorporate Bootstrap by linking to it from a CDN
- Incorporate Bootstrap by downloading it to their project directory
- Create a responsive layout that looks appropriate in both desktop and mobile browsers
- Design a website using the 12-column Grid system
- Inspect an HTML's box model using Chrome's developer tools

## jQuery
- Select a DOM element (much more easily now!)
- Modify existing elements and insert new ones
- Link to jQuery in their HTML pages in the correct place
- Incorporate jQuery code in the correct place in their HTML files
- Select HTML elements by their element type, class and ID with jQuery
- Implement the .on("click") and .on("hover") jQuery methods
- Implement the .append() jQuery method
- Implement the .remove() and .empty() jQuery methods


### Overview
In this lab exercise, you will (what they will do) and practice (what they will practice) in order to (what they will learn).

### Context
- This is what you already know, and we are building on top of it
- This is why you are doing this particular lab exercise 
- This is the value to your future self if you do this lab exercise

### Basic Requirements
1. Students will obtain a code review after (thing you want them to complete)
2. Students will obtain a code review after (other thing you want them to complete)

## Setup Instructions (DO NOT DELETE - GOES IN EVERY LAB EXERCISE)
Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on [Shell Commands](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LuOLcpSAtNQlbULx9nWgXJNhgWQlfQ4nzLWQ0DuuPQk/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance on using the Terminal.

When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znMOomkIkAkFKIz2e6t5tLpyzObKqOwfd90fsixSiec/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance.

Navigate to the `techtonica-labs` folder located in your Desktop.  
Create a new folder called `getting-started-with-node` within the `techtonica-labs` folder.  
Navigate to `getting-started-with-node`.  
Initialize `getting-started-with-node` as a git repository.  

If you have questions, do not disturb other pairs until you have spent 15-20 minutes troubleshooting within your own pair. Post a message on the #help channel in Slack if you and your pair partner are still stuck after 15-20 minutes. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O45nkq2bZX4ZDenmmA1lJ3iTvI80RXiPuOX2w__6Ykw/edit?usp=sharing) lesson.

### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the lab exercise to what was covered in the associated lecture.
- Also ask questions that connect this lab exercise to prior lessons.
- Also ask questions that require the student to put together multiple pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer or opinion.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can students work on once they have fulfilled the basic requirements for this lab exercise? 
- What do these deliverables add to their understanding of the topic?
- Extensions are designed for students who are moving through the material faster than their classmates. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this lab exercise. Students should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next lab exercise.
