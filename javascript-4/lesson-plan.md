# JavaScript 4

### Projected Time
About ___ minutes
- ___ minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- ___ minutes for Independent Practice

### Prerequisites

"JavaScript 3" lesson

### Motivation
JavaScript is used on the frontend of almost every website. It's also a widely-used scripting language that be used on the backend as well. The JavaScript lessons set a solid foundation in JavaScript basics so we can use the language in more robust ways in later lessons.

### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- Write proper JavaScript for loop syntax
- Iterate through an array using a for loop
- Write proper JavaScript while loop syntax
- Increment a counter variable properly inside a while loop

### Specific Things To Teach
- For loop syntax
- Reasons to use a for loop
- While loop syntax
- Reasons to use a while loop

### Things to Remember

- **You'll get stuck in an infinite while loop if you don't increment or decrement the counter variable.**

- **When using a for loop, remember that list indexing starts at zero!**


### Guided Practice

Have the students work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Students can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Have students summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
