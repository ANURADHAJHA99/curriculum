# Atom (Text Editor)

### Projected Time
About ___ hours
- ___ minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- 45 minutes for Independent Practice
- 15 minutes for Check for Understanding

### Prerequisites
- "Command Line Interface" lesson


### Motivation

Most software is written using text editors. Atom is a very popular open-source text editor developed and maintained by Github. Having a good understanding of how to use Atom will enable you to use other text editors with ease.

### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- Download and install Atom
- Create a Terminal shortcut to open files in Atom
- Change the UI theme of their Atom application
- Use several keyboard shortcuts for more efficient coding while using Atom

### Specific Things To Teach
- Atom-specific keyboard shortcuts

### Supplemental Materials

- [Atom's "Getting Started" manual](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/)
- [Atom Settings & Preferences (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYvMFtO71fk)

### Mini Lesson

[Local Development with Atom (video walkthrough of slides)]
- Please watch the video the first time without working along with the demonstration. Just absorb the concepts. Then, you can watch the demonstration a second time and code with the instructor if you like.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I'll just use MS Word or Google Docs to write my code."** The only industry-acceptable programs for writing code are text editors that were created specifically for this purpose. MS Word and Google Docs are for creating personal and business documents, not for writing code.


### Demonstration

Instructor demonstrates in the video walkthrough how to change the color theme and use various keyboard shortcuts.


### Independent Practice

Techtonica staff will assign pairs.

1. Follow the instructions in the slides for downloading and installing Atom if it is not already downloaded to your machine.

2. Using [Atom's Getting Started manual](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/) or other online resources, discover how to:
- Find and replace multiple occurrences of one word in the same file
- Click on multiple characters in one file at the same time
- Comment and uncomment text
- Indent and dedent lines of text
- Move one line up or down


### Challenge

Explore the many tools and keyboard shortcuts explained in [Chapter 2 of the Atom Getting Started manual](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/).

Briefly summarize your findings so you can share with the class.


### Check for Understanding

Apprentices make a cheat sheet (could be on paper or in a note on their Desktop) that reminds them how to **use shortcuts** to:

- Open Atom
- Open a specific folder in Atom
- Open a specific file in Atom
- Find and replace multiple occurrences of one word in the same file
- Click on multiple characters in one file at the same time
- Comment and uncomment text
- Indent and dedent lines of text
- Move one line up or down
